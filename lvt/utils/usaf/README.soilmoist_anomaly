* make_lvt_config_sm_anomaly_00Z.py

This is a Python script in the templates/ subdirectory to customize a
lvt.config file for soil moisture anomaly. The script will expect three
pieces of information on the command line:

  restart_dir: Directory with the LVT restart file for soil moisture
  template: Name of lvt.config template file to update.
  yyyymmdd: Date to generate anomaly (time is assumed to be 00Z).

Run ./make_lvt_config_sm_anomaly_00Z.py to see the usage statement.

The available template files (in templates/) are:

lvt.config.template_sm_anomaly_noah39
lvt.config.template_sm_anomaly_noahmp401
lvt.config.template_sm_anomaly_jules50

The script will read in the designated template and update the start and end
date/time information, the input restart file, and other relevant settings.
The resulting lvt.config file will be customized to read 3-hrly LIS ensemble
data in 1-d tile space, from either Noah.3.9, NoahMP.4.0.1, or JULES.5.0,
depending on which template is used.  LVT will process the 00Z data valid
at yyyymmdd, update the monthly climatologies from the restart file, and
generate two netCDF files:

Anomaly_TS.yyyymmdd0000.d01.nc
LVT_Anomaly_FINAL.yyyymmdd0000.d01.nc

A binary restart file LVT.yyyymmdd0000.rst will also be produced, and should
be saved for use by LVT when processing the following day's anomalies.

* run_lvt.sm_anomaly.discover.sh

This batch script (implemented in Bash) runs LVT on a single core on Discover,
using a lvt.config file customized by ./make_lvt_config_sm_anomaly_00Z.py.
It is included as a prototype for building similar batch scripts for other
computing environments.

* make_sm_geotiff.py

This Python script will read in the Anomaly_TS.yyyymmdd0000.d01.nc and
LVT_Anomaly_FINAL.yyyymmdd0000.d01.nc produced above, along with a LDT
parameter file that includes latitude/longitude information.  The script
will create GeoTIFF files containing either:

- A single layer soil moisture anomaly, valid at 00Z yyyymmdd, or
- A single layer soil moisture mean for a given month (JAN through DEC).

Altogether 52 GeoTIFF files will be created, since there are four soil layers
and twelve months of climatology plus the current anomaly.  The prefixes
for the GeoTIFF files are passed to the script at the command line.  Type
./make_sm_geotiff.py to invoke the command line usage statement.
