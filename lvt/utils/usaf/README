Scripts for use in LIS ensemble post-processing by 557WW.

run_ncks.py will merge LVT netCDF output files into to "master" files, one for
ensemble means, and one for ensemble spread.  It uses the NetCDF Operator
"ncks" utility under the hood.

convert_nc2surf.py will process the master netCDF files from run_ncks.py and
produce SURF files for input by GALWEM.

read_surf.py is a simple utility for reading SURF files, printing out 
metadata, and optionally creating simple plots.  It is only intended for
manual debugging/inspection of SURF data, not for automated production use.
