DESCRIPTION OF SCRIPTS

Last updated 3 Nov 2021

There are 5 scripts that collectively process LIS S2S forecast or hindcast
output driven by a single NMME model for 9 months.  These scripts will merge
daily SURFACEMODEL and ROUTING files together into new daily files matching
CF-1.8 convention, and then generate monthly files also in CF-1.8 convention.
A batch job script is included to automate processing of different months
in parallel, and then copy all files to a common output directory.

The scripts use the netCDF Operators (NCO) software and the UNIDATA Python
NetCDF4 library package.

These scripts were developed for use on the NASA Discover supercomputer.
Changes will be needed to run_s2spost_1month.sh if porting to a different
machine.  Paths to NCO, and the module environment for using Python NetCDF4
will also need to be updated.

In addition, a configuration file (s2spost.cfg) exists to store useful
settings, including paths on the local system.

The scripts are:

run_s2spost_9months.py:
        run_s2spost_1month.sh <- Batch job script
                run_s2spost_1month.py
                        daily_2s2post_nc.py
                        monthly_s2spost_nc.py

run_s2spost_9months.py is the overall driver. It will break up the forecast
(or hindcast) processing into 9 jobs (one job per month), and submit the jobs
to SLURM. It will then wait until all the batch jobs are complete, then
optionally copy all the CF output into the common directory.

The user will only need to execute run_s2spost_9months.py; the other scripts
will be invoked under the hood. An example invocation for processing LIS
forecasts initialized at 1 Oct 2021, forced by GEOSv2:

/path/to/run_s2spost_9months.py /path/to/s2spost.cfg GEOSv2/10 202110 GEOSv2 \
  --collect_output

run_s2spost_1month.sh is a generic batch job script that accepts command line
arguments for the NMME model, year and month to process, and other data.  It
is implemented in shell (Bash) to work best with SLURM, and is really just a
wrapper for run_s2spost_1month.py.

run_s2spost_1month.py will automate generation of daily and monthly CF files
for the specified month and NMME model.  It loops across every day and
invokes daily_s2spost_nc.py for that day. The monthly_s2spost_nc.py script is
then invoked at the end.

Finally, daily_s2spost_nc.py is the worker script for automating NCO, while
monthly_s2spost_nc.py merges the daily CF files together and performs
temporal averaging and accumulation, as appropriate.

NOTE: Generation of anomaly and standardize anomaly metrics is handled by
a separate set of scripts, using the monthly CF files produced by the
scripts described above.
