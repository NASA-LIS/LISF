This directory contains a script (make_s2s_metric_geotiff.py) developed to
generate a GeoTIFF file for each ensemble member of each calculated metric.
Because of the enormous number of resulting GeoTIFF files, this script was
pulled from development and replaced with make_s2s_median_metric_geotiff.py.

The make_s2s_metric_geotiff.py is kept here for reference, in case 557WW
customers request such GeoTIFFs.  Code changes will be required to integrate
this script with the rest of s2smetric, so for now, DO NOT USE.
