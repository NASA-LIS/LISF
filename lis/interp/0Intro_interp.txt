!The spatial interpolation tools in LIS are used for the geospatial
!transformation of an input data to the LIS grid. The tools in LIS
!are based on the ipolates package developed at NCEP. Currently LIS
!supports the transformation and interpolation of polar stereographic,
!lambert conformal, and mercator grid projection data on to an
!equidistant cylindrical (lat/lon) grid projection. Bilinear,
!conservative and neighbor search interpolations are supported.
