== Restricted codes

This directory is for use by the LIS development team.  Code contained in this directory *MAY NOT* be distributed to others.

For a typical checkout or release of LIS, this directory will be empty, except of course for this README file.


== For LIS developers

=== How to use this directory

.Initial steps:
. Checkout the LIS source code
+
`svn checkout /path/to/development`

. `cd RESTRICTED`

. Checkout the restricted code
+
`svn checkout /path/to/restricted/lsm`


After some development, running `svn status` will show which files you have been working on.

....
% svn status
?       RESTRICTED/lsm
M       core/LIS_histDataMod.F90
....

Note that the restricted lsm that you checked out in Step 2 is marked with a '?'.  Please do not attempt to `svn add` or `svn import` this into the development branch.

.Steps for committing
. Run `svn update` both in the top directory of your LIS source code and in the RESTRICTED/lsm directory.  Resolve any conflicts.

. Write and save a commit message into a text file, say commit.msg.

. Commit the updates in the development branch first.
+
....
% svn commit --file commit.msg core/LIS_histDataMod.F90
Sending        core/LIS_histDataMod.F90
Transmitting file data .done
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 13.
....
+
Make note of the committed revision number.

. If the updates in RESTRICTED/lsm are related to the updates just committed, then amend the commit.msg file to reference that commit.  For example, append this to the end of the commit.msg file:
+
"This commit must be used with /path/to/development r13."
+
Else write a new relevant message.

. `cd RESTRICTED/lsm` and `svn commit --file ../../commit.msg file1`

. Run `svn update` both in the top directory of your LIS source code and in the RESTRICTED/lsm directory.
