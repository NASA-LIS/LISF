!\section{Noah land surface model version 2.7.1}
!This section describes the interface implementations for the Noah
!land surface model.  The community Noah Land Surface Model is a
!stand-alone, uncoupled, 1-D column model freely available at the
!National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP;~\cite{noah}).
!The name is an acronym representing the various developers of the
!model (N: NCEP; O: Oregon State University, Dept. of Atmospheric
!Sciences; A: Air Force (both AFWA and AFRL - formerly AFGL, PL);
!and H: Hydrologic Research Lab - NWS (now Office of Hydrologic
!Development -- OHD)).  Noah can be executed in either coupled or
!uncoupled mode.  It has been coupled with the operational NCEP
!mesoscale Eta model~\cite{chen} and its companion Eta Data Assimilation
!System (EDAS)~\cite{rogers}, and the NCEP Global Forecast System
!(GFS) and its companion Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS).
!When Noah is executed in uncoupled mode, near-surface atmospheric
!forcing data (e.g., precipitation, radiation, wind speed, temperature,
!humidity) is required as input. Noah simulates soil moisture (both
!liquid and frozen), soil temperature, skin temperature, snowpack
!depth, snowpack water equivalent, canopy water content, and the
!energy flux and water flux terms of the surface energy balance and
!surface water balance. The model applies finite-difference spatial
!discretization methods and a Crank-Nicholson time-integration scheme
!to numerically integrate the governing equations of the physical
!processes of the soil vegetation-snowpack medium, including the
!surface energy balance equation, Richards'~\cite{richards} equation
!for soil hydraulics, the diffusion equation for soil heat transfer,
!the energy-mass balance equation for the snowpack, and the
!Jarvis~\cite{jarvis} equation for the conductance of canopy
!transpiration.
