!\section{Community Land Model version 2.0}
!This section describes the interface implementations for the CLM
!land surface model.  CLM (Community Land Model) is a 1-D land surface
!model, written in Fortran 90, developed by a grass-roots collaboration
!of scientists who have an interest in making a general land model
!available for public use. LIS currently uses CLM version 2.0. CLM
!version 2.0 was released in May 2002.  The source code for CLM 2.0
!is freely available from the National Center for Atmospheric Research
!(NCAR)~\cite{clm}.  The CLM is used as the land model for the
!Community Climate System Model (CCSM) (http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/),
!which includes the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)
!(http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/). CLM is executed with all forcing,
!parameters, dimensioning, output routines, and coupling performed
!by an external driver of the user's design (in this case done by
!LIS).  CLM requires pre-processed data such as the land surface
!type, soil and vegetation parameters, model initialization, and
!atmospheric boundary conditions as input. The model applies
!finite-difference spatial discretization methods and a fully implicit
!time-integration scheme to numerically integrate the governing
!equations. The model subroutines apply the governing equations of
!the physical processes of the soil-vegetation-snowpack medium,
!including the surface energy balance equation, Richards'~\cite{richards}
!equation for soil hydraulics, the diffusion equation for soil heat
!transfer, the energy-mass balance equation for the snowpack, and
!the Collatz et al.~\cite{collatz} formulation for the conductance
!of canopy transpiration.
