  This routine computes the annual average July temperature for the 
  current gridcell.  The temperature is than lapsed to determine the 
  elevation at which the annual average temperature is equal to 10C.
  Snow elevation bands above this elevation are considered to be above
  the treeline.  When gridcell data is output at the end of each time 
  step, vegetation types with overstory will be excluded from the 
  variable averages of snow bands higher than the treeline (e.g. decidous
  trees will be removed from high elevation snow bands, while grass
  and shrubs will remain).  This is to serve as a preliminary fix for
  high elevation "glaciers", a more permanent version would actually 
  allow for vegetation types to be excluded from various snow bands.

  Modifications:
  2009-Jan-12 Added extra input parameter (avgJulyAirTemp) and logic to
	      handle it in the event JULY_TAVG_SUPPLIED is TRUE.		TJB
  2012-Jun-06 Modified by Shugong Wang for use in LIS-VIC implementation.
          Computation of average July air temperature has been removed.
