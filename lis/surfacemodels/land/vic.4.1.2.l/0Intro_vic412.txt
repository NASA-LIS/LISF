!\section{VIC land surface model version 4.1.2.l}
!This section describes the interface implementations for the 
!Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) Macroscale Hydrologic Model,
!version 4.1.2.l, available from 
!
!http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/index.shtml
!
!\subsection{Notes regarding incorporating VIC 4.1.2.l into LIS}
!VIC's control loop behaves oppositely from that of LIS (and the other
!land surface models that it contains).  LIS' control loop has time as
!the outer loop and space as the inner loop; whereas, VIC's control loop
!has space as the outer loop and time as the inner loop.
!
!Viewing this in terms of data, LIS processes the desired running domain
!as a 2d gridded field that is one time-level deep; whereas, VIC
!processes the same running domain one grid cell at a time as a one grid
!cell structure that is many time-levels deep.  In other words, for LIS,
!at time $t_1$, LIS processes forcing for the whole domain, then it advances
!the model state for the whole domain.  Then LIS advances time to $t_2$ and
!repeats.  For VIC, VIC selects grid cell $x_1$, then it processes forcing
!for that grid cell from the beginning to the end of the simulation, then
!it advances the model state from the beginning to the end of the
!simulation.  Then VIC selects grid cell $x_2$ and repeats.
!
!This difference in approach complicated incorporating VIC into LIS.  To
!overcome this without modifying the VIC source code, two steps were
!taken.  Step 1 was to create an intermediate layer of data structures
!and supporting routines.  Step 2 was to tell VIC that the simulation was
!only one time step long.  These two steps allow LIS to pass data into
!VIC, have VIC advance its model state forward one time step, and to
!store the new state for use in the next call to VIC at the next LIS time
!step.

!\subsection{Limitations of VIC 4.1.2.l within LIS}
!VIC has many compile time and run time options that modify the behavior
!of its underlying physics.  VIC within LIS (LIS-VIC) has been tested
!only for VIC's basic water balance configuration and for VIC's basic
!energy balance configuration.  Other configuration options are not
!guaranteed to work.
