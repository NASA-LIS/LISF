# Introduction

The Land Information System (LIS) is a surface model wrapper developed
and maintained by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
LIS abstracts several land and ocean surface models with standard
interfaces. The LIS cap wraps LIS with NUOPC compliant interfaces. The
result is configurable surface model capable of coupling with other models
in the National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC).  As of
LIS version 7.1 only Noah v3.3, NoahMP v3.6, and NoahMP v4.0.1 have two-way
NUOPC coupling capabilities.

For the User's Guide please see the [User's Guide](docs/1_users_guide.md).

For the Developer's Guide please see the [Developer's Guide](docs/2_developers_guide.md).
