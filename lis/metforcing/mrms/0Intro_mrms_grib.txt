!This section describes the implementation of the operational
!Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) precipitation product from NOAA/NSSL.
!This reader has been designed to read the 0.01x0.01 degree hourly 
!gauge-corrected product as well as an optional user-defined mask defining
!the quality of the radar precipitation forcing. This mask must also be on
!the MRMS grid.
