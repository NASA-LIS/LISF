!\section{VIC-processed Forcing}
!This section describes the implementation of the reader for VIC-processed
!forcing data.
!
!The purpose of this reader is to read forcing data that has been processed
!by a stand-alone run of VIC.
!
!The VIC land surface model's forcing data processing routines are aware of
!22 input forcing variables.  These routines process the provided 
!input forcing variables to generate the 10 final atmospheric forcing
!variables that drive the land surface physics.
!
!The logic for processing the input forcing variables is complex, and
!depending on which input forcing variables are supplied, these routines
!\begin{itemize}
!\item compute final atmospheric forcing variables from the supplied
!      input forcing variables,
!\item derive final atmospheric forcing variables from the supplied
!      input forcing variables and computed atmospheric forcing variables,
!\item estimate final atmospheric forcing variables.
!\end{itemize}
!
!For example the Stehekin test-case supplies four input forcing variables,
!and the Pilps test-case supplies seven.  From these, the 10 final
!atmospheric forcing variables are generated.  These two test-cases are
!found at
!http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/index.shtml
!
!Due to several technical difficulties, logic was written to read in the
!VIC-processed final atmospheric forcing data rather than to try to process
!the input forcing data within LIS.
!
!To produce the VIC-processed final atmospheric forcing data,
!one must first run a stand-alone VIC simulation.
!
!\begin{enumerate}
!\item Add the write\_bin\_atmosdata.c file to the stand-alone VIC
!      source code.
!\item Call the write\_bin\_atmosdata routine in vicNl after
!      the call to initialize\_atmos.
!\item Run stand-alone VIC.  Stand-alone VIC will then process all the
!      raw forcing input data and produce the entries for the atmos
!      data structure.  The write\_bin\_atmosdata routine will
!      write these entries to disk as 4-byte values (to be consistent
!      with LIS).
!\item Run the forcing regridding utility.  This reads the output from the
!      write\_bin\_atmosdata routine and grids it.
!\end{enumerate}
