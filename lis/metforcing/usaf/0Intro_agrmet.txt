!The Agricultural Meteorological Modeling System (AGRMET) developed
!at the United States Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) is a near
!real-time operational system that generates land surface conditions
!for agricultural applications.  AGRMET generates the shortwave
!radiation budget at the surface using the algorithm of~\cite{shapiro}.
!The effects of cloud and snow cover are incorporated using the AFWA
!RTNEPH 3-hourly global cloud analysis~\cite{hamill}. The satellite
!images from the polar orbiting satellites of the Defense Meteorological
!Satellite Program (DMSP) and NOAA satellites systems are used to
!generate the RTNEPH products.  The AGRMET analysis are available
!on two polar stereographic grids (one for each hemisphere) at 48km
!resolution. Starting late June 2002, RTNEPH was replaced by a new
!integrated product called the World Wide Merged Cloud Analysis
!(WWMCA). In addition to the RTNEPH, the WWMCA product incorporates
!geostationary satellite images as well, at a higher spatial resolution
!of 24km.
