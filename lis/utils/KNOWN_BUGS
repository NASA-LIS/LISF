Support for Absoft compiler
---------------------------
There are known issues if the absoft compiler version is older than 
version 10.  Please upgrade your compiler if you are using an older
version.
Interp routines in LIS
-----------------------
* The interp routines in LIS has a limitation of not able to 
  interpolate/reproject using either bilinear or conservative
  approaches from a global subgrid to the exact global subgrid. 
  
  For example, lets a dataset spans only over the US and the 
  user wants to interpolate the data to the exact same grid 
  over the US, using bilinear interpolation. The logic in the 
  interp program assume that all neighbor information is valid. 
  As a result, on the edges, the program will fail to find valid
  neighbor information (for a bilinear interp, it looks for a 
  4x4 grid). 
  
  This is not an issue if interpolation is performed from a global
  dataset since it will wraparound and find neighbors. Also this 
  is not an issue if the interpolated domain is a subset of the 
  input dataset domain. 

Diagnostic output in the data assimilation routines
----------------------------------------------------
Note that the text output (writing each ensemble member, 
writing observations) in the EnKF diagnostics is intended 
for debugging purposes only. These outputs currently do 
not work in a parallel mode. The normalized innovations 
output, however, works in the parallel mode as well as 
in the serial mode.
