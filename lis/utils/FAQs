These are some common issues reported with LIS. 
------------------------------------------------
1. When I run LIS, it produces a number of PET*ESMF_LogFile files. 
   This is most probably due to an error in the lis.config file being used in the run. Please check    for consistency with the sample lis.config files provided in the src/configs directory

2. My restart file from a previous LIS simulation does not work
   Make sure the domain and tiling options are setup exactly the same way 
   as the run that originally produced the restart file. Restarts generated
   using LIS version older than 4.3 is not recommended for use in LIS 5.0. 

3. My Run is crashing while running a spinup for the WRF initialization 
   My restart file from the LIS spinup does not work with the coupled LIS-WRF
  
 When running a spinup for coupled LIS-WRF, make sure that the INC_WATER_PTS 
 is defined in the src/make/misc.h file. Further, the number of vegetation
 classes defined in the lis.config file should include the definition of water
 points as a pseudo landcover class. For example, if the UMD landcover 
 classification is used, the number of vegetation classes should be 14 (as
 opposed to 13 for an offline case). Finally, the lookup tables used by 
 the land surface models should also reflect the addition of the 'water'
 landcover class.
