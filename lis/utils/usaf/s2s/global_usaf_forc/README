* For running on Discover, you will load the following module:
  LISF/env/discover/lisf_7.5_intel_2021.4.0_s2s

* On HPC-11, the latest module is:
    lisf_7.5_prgenv_cray_8.3.3_s2s 
  which uses afw-python/3.9-202203

There are 3 scripts used to configure and run LIS to generate USAF global
atmospheric forcing data via "AGRMET Ops" mode.  These are located in the
LISF distribution under: lis/utils/usaf/s2s/global_usaf_forc/.  

They are:

run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh:  <- Batch job script
        customize_lis_config.py
        store_lis_output.py

o run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh is a batch job script developed for the NASA
   Discover supercomputer environment, and will need to be modified to port to
   another system.  This is submitted to the SLURM batch queueing system and
   accepts a rundate for customizing the case. It sets up the runtime environment
   (via module commands); and runs customize_lis_config.py to generate a 
   lis.config file from a template; runs LIS via MPI; and runs store_lis_output.py 
   to clean-up directories after the run.  

 It is designed to be very simple, and delegate as much work as possible 
  to the Python scripts.

o customize_lis_config.py will read in a lis.config template and create a new,
   lis.config file with updated start and end times and restart file path.

o store_lis_output.py will copy most GRIB1 output files to a new, semi-permanent
   directory for subsequent use by S2S land DA LIS runs.  (The first GRIB1 file
   valid at the start of the LIS run is skipped, since it has no precipitation
   data.) Also, the restart file produced at t=24 hrs is copied to a ./restart
   directory (e.g., input/restarts/), for use by the next LIS forcing run.
