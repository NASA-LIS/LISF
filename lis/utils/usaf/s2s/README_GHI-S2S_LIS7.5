1. INTRODUCTION

This document describes the software and steps used to run the GHI S2S
 end-to-end system (E2ES) forcing and model initial conditions, forecasts 
 with LIS, generate netCDF4 formatted output files, and produce key metrics 
 of the forecast output.

Postprocessing of LIS-based NoahMP4.0.1 and HYMAP2 is supported in terms
 of combining the output files and providing in CF-compliant netCDF output
 that is compliant with USAF naming conventions.

  2.2  SETTING UP THE EXPERIMENT DIRECTORY

 The main GHI S2S subsystem software is found in your
  latest LIS 7.5 557WW code tarball, within the directory
  structure:

   lisf-557ww-7.5/lis/utils/usaf/s2s/

 The main E2ES script that runs the S2S subsystem is a 
  bash shell script and is located in the directory:   

   s2s_app/s2s_run.sh
  
 In setting up your main or experiment directory, you
  can simply symbolically link to the "s2s_app" directory,
  which gives you access as well to the key modules and 
  routines that are the underpinning of the E2E system. 

 Also, in the "s2s_app" directory are different text-based 
  S2S configuration files (YAML file format), which is the 
  main input and option based file to setup and drive the E2ES steps. 

 For the E2ES "forecast" setup, you will want to copy:  
    s2s_config_global_fcst

  to your local run directory. In here, you will modify the
  paths in the first section list, under "SETUP:" 

 SETUP:
  LISFDIR: [DIRECTORY_PATH_OF_YOUR_LISF_TOP-LEVEL-CODE_DIRECTORY]
  E2ESDIR: [YOUR_LOCAL_WORKING-RUN_DIRECTORY_PATH]
  METFORC: [MAIN_USAF_FORCING_AND_SATELLITE_DATA_DIRECTORY_PATH]
  LISFMOD: lisf_7.5_intel_2021.4.0_s2s  [OR LOCAL MACHINE LISF MODULE LIBRARY LIST]
  SPCODE: s1189    [YOUR LOCAL MACHINE GROUPID CODE]
  DATATYPE: forecast  [OPTIONS INCLUDE:  "forecast" or "hindcast"]
  supplementarydir:  [YOUR GHI_S2S/supplementary_files DIRECTORY PATH WITH RUNTIME INPUT FILES]
  ldtinputfile:  [FILENAME FOR THE LDT-GENERATED MODEL INPUT PARAMETER FILE] 

  * The "ldtinputfile" file will be provided as part of the E2ES 
    use-case input file package, with the naming convention of:

    lis_input.s2s_global.noahmp401_hymap2.25km.nc

  * Also, the files found in the "supplementarydir", will be
    provided in the E2ES use-case input file package with a
    README file to describe the input files.

 Then below in your "s2s_config_global_fcst" file, you will see
  additional config lists and entries that may require updates.
  This would include the "BCSD:" list:

 BCSD:
  fcst_download_dir: [DIRECTORY_PATH_WHERE_CFSV2_FORECAST_FILES_ARE_DOWNLOADED]
  nmme_download_dir: [DIRECTORY_PATH_WHERE_NMME_FORECAST_FILES_ARE_DOWNLOADED]
  ... 

 Currently, the climatology-based years are set from 1991-2020, 
  which will be reflected in the climatology input files that
  will be part of the supplementary input file package.

 Note: CFSv2 does have up to 24 members in the seasonal forecast
  files (for the NMME configuration), but for our S2S setup, we use 
  the first 12 members up to the start of the 1st of the month.
 

3. RUNNING THE GHI S2S SUBSYSTEM

  3.1  s2s_run.sh USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

 The main or "master" shell script to run the E2ES step
  utilizes:  s2s_app/s2s_run.sh

 To view the inputs and instructions, run:

  sh s2s_app/s2s_run.sh -h

 ( or make sure "s2s_run.sh" has executable permission 
   and run as:  ./s2s_app/s2s_run.sh )
 
 The main usage with mandatory and optional entries is:

  s2s_app/s2s_run.sh -y YEAR -m MONTH -c CONFIG_FILE -d DELETE -r REPORT -s STEP -o ONE_STEP

 where MANDATORY input parameters are:
 -------------------------------------
  YEAR:        start year
  MONTH:       start month [1 to 12]
  CONFIG_FILE: main S2S config file (for hindcast or forecast run modes), e.g., s2s_config_global_fcst
 
  Thus, s2s_app/s2s_run.sh -y YEAR -m MONTH -c CONFIG_FILE  can run the 
   complete E2ES process for one YEAR/MONTH forecast (9-month) period.

 with OPTIONAL flags:
 --------------------
  REPORT:   Once the E2ES process has begun (jobs have been submitted), 
             the REPORT flag is helpful to check the progress of SLURM jobs 
             (valid inputs for -r: Y or N).

  STEP:     The E2ES process includes seven steps that are run sequentially:
             LISDA, LDTICS, BCSD, FCST, POST, METRICS, PLOTS.
            However, the STEP option allows the user to kick start the process 
             from the last completed step.
            -s STEP allows s2s_run.sh to start from a specific STEP 
             (valid inputs: LISDA, LDTICS, BCSD, FCST, POST, METRICS or PLOTS).

  ONE_STEP: This flag is set to run only the above -s STEP (valid inputs: Y or N). 
             If ONE_STEP is set to Y, the process will exit upon completion of the
             above STEP entry.

  DELETE:   Delete generated forecast YEAR/MONTH directory (valid inputs: Y or N).
 -------------------

 To run a single step, you will select the following options, for example 
  the BCSD step:

  sh s2s_app/s2s_run.sh -y 2022 -m 9 -c s2s_config_global_fcst -s BCSD -o Y

 would run just the BCSD step and scripts.


  3.2  MONITORING THE STATUS OF THE FORECAST

 Users can monitor the full suite of steps when initialized from the
  start of an E2ES run, using the same s2s_run.sh main script.

 The report option allows the user to check the order, processing SLURM
  job time, and final computational resource usage and time information.

 An example of how to monitor an E2ES set of SLURM jobs, for an 09-2022
  forecast:

 sh s2s_app/s2s_run.sh -y 2022 -m 9 -c s2s_config_global_fcst -r Y

 The "-r" flag option with "Y" set allows the user to see the 
  following information, e.g.:

#######################################################################
                          STATUS OF SLURM JOBS

 ELAPSED TIME :  1d 08h 14m 52s
 -------------------------------

 The above example report output will show all the E2ES
  steps being run and the amount of wall-clock time
  estimated per job. This monitoring option can be 
  initiated at any time during or after runtime.


  3.3  DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

 The main GHI S2S code directory structure, in addition to 
  the LDT and LIS executables needed, follow the below 
  main heirarchy.

 lis/utils/usaf/s2s/s2s_app/
 --------------------------
 ├── s2s_run.sh
 ├── s2s_config_global_fcst
 ├── s2s_config_global_hcast
 ├── download_nmme_precip.sh
 ├── wget_cfsv2_oper_ts_e2es.sh
 ├── nctool.py
 └── s2s_api.py

 lis/utils/usaf/s2s/s2s_modules/
 ------------------------------
 ├── bcsd_fcst
 ├── lis_darun
 ├── ldt_ics
 ├── lis_fcst
 ├── s2spost
 ├── s2smetric
 └── s2splots

 This S2S directory tree structure outlines the 
  main routines and scripts applied in the E2ES steps
  for current final operational configurations (FOCs).

 * Note: A "hindcast" directory is also symbolically
     linked to the climatology input files required for
     the "bcsd_fcst" step and the output hindcast files
     from the s2spost step, required for the s2smetric
     step. These files will be provided separately to
     the user for set up and running these required
     steps for the E2E forecast subsystem.

 When you begin to run the E2ES and each of the 
  sequential steps, the following output directories
  are written to your main run directory (same directory 
  names as found in s2s_modules):
 ├── bcsd_fcst
 ├── lis_darun
 ├── ldt_ics
 ├── lis_fcst
 ├── s2spost
 ├── s2smetric
 └── s2splots
 * Note: The generation of the S2S global USAF forcing
    required to run the lis_darun step is performed 
    outside of the E2ES, as a lead-up to running the 
    E2E forecast step. More details are provided below in
 └── global_usaf_forc

 Once the main shell script is running, then all log files, 
  slurm script files, and other runtime output files are 
  written to a temporary run directory, called "scratch". 
  The structure of "scratch" and related log files is set
  up as:
  
  [E2ES_RUN_DIRECTORY]/scratch/[YYYYMM of Forecast]/ ...
   SLURM_JOB_SCHEDULE  [Text-file that keeps track of the SLURM
                        job IDs and any related dependency jobs]
   ├── bcsd_fcst
   ├── ldt_ics
   ├── lis_darun
   ├── lis_fcst
   ├── s2smetric
   ├── s2spost
   └── s2splots  
   └── global_usaf_forc  [Symbolic link to the input Grib-1 forcing
                          files used for the lis_darun step]

 ** Additional directory tree structure and script listings
   can be found near the bottom of this document in Appendix A.


4. E2E PROCESS AND STEPS

 Given in the order of which they are run in the main E2ES script:

  4.1 DOWNLOADING FORECAST INPUT FORCINGS

    * NOTE: Aim to have all forecast files downloaded by the 9th
            of each month.  More information below.

    4.1.1 Downloading CFSv2 forcing files

    - To download the CFSv2 forecast files used for the forecast
       E2ES setup, the following script has been provided for reference:
 
       s2s_app/wget_cfsv2_oper_ts_e2es.sh   

    * Note:  In the case that any files that are downloaded are found
        to actually be missing from the cloud servers or may only contain
        partial records, we have provided a set of instructions on
        our approach to "patching" those missing and/or corrupt files
        by using neighboring CFSv2 dates.

      For our current solution, please follow the steps outlined in our
        accompanying README file:

        s2s_app/README_CFSv2_PATCHING
 
      More examples and details are provided in that file.

 
    4.1.2 Downloading NMME precipitation forcing files

    - To download the NMME forecast files used for the forecast
       E2ES setup, the following script has been provided for reference:

       s2s_app/download_nmme_precip.sh

    * Note: Based on experience, we have found that IRI/Columbia University
         try to have all NMME model-based files uploaded by the 8th or 9th of 
         each month.  When running the above script and if not all precipitation 
         files are available yet, a message will be given be along with the 
         following option, for example:

       Precipitation forecasts are available for only 2 NMME models (GEOS5v2 CCM4). 
       Do you want to continue (Y/N)?

      We recommend the user to wait until all files are available on the IRI/Columbia
       University server before proceeding with the remaining E2E steps. 


  4.2 GLOBAL USAF FORCING (Stand-alone step from E2ES)
    global_usaf_forc:  Generate AGRMET Ops atmospheric forcing for S2S

  - This forcing step configures and runs LIS in AGRMET Ops mode to generate
    atmospheric forcing for subsequent S2S data assimilation runs. No land DA
    is performed, and the ensemble size is set to 1. Gridded output is
    restricted to atmospheric forcing variables in GRIB1 format, which are
    saved (along with the final restart file) for subsequent use by S2S.

  - 3 scripts to configure and run LIS to generate USAF global atmospheric
    forcing data via "AGRMET Ops" mode. Scripts located in:

    LISF/lis/utils/usaf/s2s/global_usaf_forc/

    - run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh:   <== Batch job script
      Calls:
      - customize_lis_config.py
      - store_lis_output.py

    - Set entries in run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh for output directory and
      scripts path; instructions can be found in the README file there.

    - Submit shell script via SLURM (sbatch), e.g.,:
    sbatch /absolute/path/to/run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh 20220801

 ** MAIN E2ES STEPS ** 

  4.3 LIS-DA RUN
    lis_darun:  Run the LIS Data Assimilation (DA) step to generate
               the initial conditions (ICs) for the forecast runs

  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM and the HYMAP2 routing model
    in LIS for a 1-month simulation, with daily outputs, using
    12-member ensemble soil moisture assimilation for the 557WW
    ~25-km S2S global domain.

  - The main shell script, s2s_run.sh, generates the LIS config file 
    and runs the LIS executable, designed to run for 1-month, up 
    to the first of the initialized forecast month. 

  4.4 LDT-ICs
    ldt_ics:  Runs LDT to generate the IC ensemble restart files from
             the LIS DA run in Step #2 (Section 4.3 above).

  - This step generates the six NMME model-based ensemble restart files
    required to initialize the six NMME model-based forecasts using the LDT
    executable for the 557WW S2S global ~25KM domain for the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM.

  - HyMAP2 routing model restart files are single-member at this time, so
    they are copied from the LIS DA run directories for operations.

  - The main script, s2s_run.sh, runs the ldt_ics python script:
     generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

  - Output generated includes varying NMME model ensemble members for NoahMP401
    restart file and single member of HyMAP2 restart copied over for the
    forecast initial conditions.

  4.5 BCSD
    bcsd_fcst:  Runs the Bias-Correction Spatial-Downscaling (BCSD) Method
               scripts on the NMME and CFSv2 forecast datasets

  - This step preprocesses CFSv2 (non-precip) and 6 separate NMME
    forecast model precipitation data for driving the models offline in LIS.
    The forecasts are for the 557 WW ~25KM global domain, bias-corrected
    using the USAF-LIS7.5-S2S (e.g., NAFPA precipitation) dataset, and covers
    up to 9 months of forecast as input data to LIS.

  - 13 high-level scripts (1 main and 12 individual task scripts) to create
    bias-corrected and downscaled forecast forcings. They are also driven
    by the main s2s_run.sh script.

  - Scripts located in:  bcsd_fcst

  - Additional info can be found in the README file for hi-level scripts.

  4.6 LIS FORECAST
    lis_fcst:  Running the LIS forecast step

  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 land surface model (LSM) and the
    HyMAP2 routing model in LIS using 12-member bias-corrected CFSv2 forcing
    (one of the six NMME models) for the ~25KM S2S global domain in
    "forecast" run-mode, and NMME models' precipitation ensembles.

  - 1 script to produce LIS forecast configs/sbatch script files and submits
    LIS runs for all six NMME models' precipitation forecast inputs.
    The main script, run_s2s.sh, will drive all these steps.

  - Script located in:  lis_fcst

  - Entries for the NMME and CFSv2 models are found in the main S2S 
    configuration script (e.g., s2s_config_global_fcst):
     CCM4, CCSM4, CFSv2, GEOSv2, GFDL, GNEMO

  4.7 S2S POST-PROCESSING
    s2spost:  S2S forecast output post-process step

  - This step automates the conversion of LIS S2S-Global forecast output
    into daily and monthly netCDF4 files and ensures they are in CF-1.8
    USAF naming conventions.

  - 5 scripts used to combine SURFACEMODEL and RUNOFF LIS netCDF files into
    daily and monthly netCDF files in CF-1.8 convention. The scripts are 
    driven by the main script, s2s_run.sh.

  - Scripts located in:  s2spost
     run_s2spost_9months.py:   <== Top-level python script
       run_s2spost_1month.py:
         daily_s2spost_nc.py
           monthly_s2spost_nc.py

  4.8 S2S METRICS COMPUTATION
    s2smetric:  S2S forecast metric post-process step

  - This step and set of scripts processes metrics for individual
    NMME model's LIS-based hydrologic monthly forecasts out to 9 months for
    a given month and year's initial condition.

  - The scripts read in the monthly post-processed files from the s2spost
    step (Section 4.7), requiring inputs as well from the hindcast s2spost step.

  - Final set of scripts convert the intermediate-based metric (netcdf) files
    to CF-1.8 convention, and merges the output into a single file.

  - Again, the main s2s_run.sh script calls the 8 s2smetric scripts to 
    calculate metrics (anomalies, std anomalies), convert into
    CF-1.8 netCDF4 files, and create GeoTIFFs of median ensemble values.

  - Scripts located in:  s2smetric

   - postprocess_nmme_job.py:
     calls:
     - lib_bcsd_metrics/convert_dyn_fcst_to_anom.py:
     - lib_bcsd_metrics/convert_dyn_fcst_to_sanom.py:
         - lib_bcsd_metrics/metricslib.py
     - convert_s2s_anom_cf.py
     - merge_s2s_anom_cf.py
     - make_s2s_median_metric_geotiff.py


  4.9 S2S PLOTS

   (Currently offered as optional for operational staff if
    they would like to plot the output for checking the runs)


***
THIS COMPLETES ALL STEPS IN THE E2ES SEQUENCE.
***

5. nctool.py UTILITY

 A python script designed to support the following options:

(1) Print Mean, Maximum (Maxloc) and Minimum (Minloc) of each spatial layer, separately for each variable:

     nctool.py file_name

(2) Compare 2 netcdf files:
     a) check closeness at absolute tolerance of 1.e-3:
         nctool.py file1 file2

     b) check whether the 2 files are identical:
         nctool.py file1 file2 zero_diff

(3) Compare all netcdf files with similar names in two directories (including sub-directories):
     a) check closeness at absolute tolerance of 1.e-3:
         nctool.py directory1 directory2

     b) check whether the 2 are identical:
         nctool.py directory1 directory2 zero_diff

(4) This is also good to print variable value[s] at a specific location specified by 
    lat/lon OR J_INDEX [north-south dimension] and I_INDEX [west-east dimension] as in the netCDF file.
    First ncdump -h and get exact names of lat, lon and the variable from the netCDF header.

      nctool.py lat lon latname longname var_name filename

    Example 1 (when lat/lon at the place are known - the script will map the place on the grid space 
               and indentify the grid cell that where the place is located.):

     nctool.py -0.8486657635296301 32.97690772217679 latitude longitude anom [full_path]/E2ES/s2smetric/output/202203/DYN_ANOM/GLOBAL/NOAHMP/GNEMO5_Surface-SM_ANOM_init_monthly_03_2022.nc

   Example 2 (when J_INDEX and I_INDEX at the location are known):

     nctool.py j_index i_index lat lon Evap_tavg [full_path]/E2ES/lis_darun/output/SURFACEMODEL/202204/LIS_HIST_202204010000.d01.nc
