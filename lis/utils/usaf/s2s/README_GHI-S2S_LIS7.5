557WW LIS 7.5 -- S2S Forecast End-to-End System (E2ES) Master Doc
 NASA/GSFC GHI-S2S Team 
Last Modified 3 October 2022

This document describes the software and steps used to run the S2S-Global
forcing and model initial conditions, forecasts with LIS, generate netCDF4
formatted output files, and produce key metrics of the forecast output.

Postprocessing of LIS-NoahMP4.0.1 and HYMAP2 is supported in terms
of combining the output files and providing in CF-compliant netCDF output
that is compliant with USAF naming conventions.

LIST OF STEPS AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS:

0. ldt_parms:  LDT Model Parameter Processing

  - LDT parameter processing case, where you set up and run
    LDT and the given ldt.config file and input parameters to
    generate the required LIS input parameter file that supports
    both Noah-MP v4.0.1 ("NoahMP401") and HyMAP v2 ("HyMAP2")
    models.

  - Location:  ldt_parms

  - Note: This step only needs to be performed once as an input
    for the subsequent LIS and pre- and post-processing steps
    of the End-to-End system.

## THE REMAINING STEPS ARE FOR THE MAIN E2ES SCRIPT:
## TO BE UPDATED ... ## 

 -- Given in the order of which they are run in the main E2ES script:

## ASK ERIC TO UPDATE STEP #1 BELOW ##
1. global_usaf_forc:  Generate AGRMET Ops atmospheric forcing for S2S

  - This forcing step configures and runs LIS in AGRMET Ops mode to generate
    atmospheric forcing for subsequent S2S data assimilation runs. No land DA
    is performed, and the ensemble size is set to 1. Gridded output is
    restricted to atmospheric forcing variables in GRIB1 format, which are
    saved (along with the final restart file) for subsequent use by S2S.

  - 3 scripts to configure and run LIS to generate USAF global atmospheric
    forcing data via "AGRMET Ops" mode. Scripts located in:

    LISF/lis/configs/557WW-7.4-FOC/S2S_GLOBAL
    - run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh:   <== Batch job script
      Calls:
      - customize_lis_config.py
      - store_lis_output.py

    - Set entries in run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh for output directory and
      scripts path; instructions can be found in the README file there.

    - Submit shell script via SLURM (sbatch), e.g.,:
    sbatch /absolute/path/to/run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh 20210801


2. lis_darun:  Run the LIS Data Assimilation (DA) Step to Generate
               the Initial Conditions (ICs) for the Forecast Runs

  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM and the HYMAP2 routing model
    in LIS for a 1-month simulation, with daily outputs, using
    12-member ensemble soil moisture and snow data assimilation for
    the 557WW ~25-km S2S Global domain.

  - The batch script runs the LIS executable with the lis.config generated
    by the Python script – designed to run for 1-month, up to the first of the
    initialized forecast month. For more details, please see README file
    at the above scripts directory.


3. ldt_ics:  Run LDT to Generate the IC Ensemble Restart Files from
             the LIS DA Run in Step #2.

  - This step generates the six NMME model-based ensemble restart files
    required to initialize the six NMME model-based forecasts using the LDT
    software for the 557WW S2S Global ~25KM domain for the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM.

  - HyMAP2 routing model restart files are single-member at this time, so
    they will be copied from the LIS DA run directories during operations.

  - 1 python script, located in:  ldt_ics
  - Run python script from command line or called from a master E2ES script:

     ./generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

  - Output generated includes varying NMME model ensemble members for NoahMP401
    restart file and single member of HyMAP2 restart copied over for the
    forecast initial conditions.


4. bcsd_fcst:  Run the Bias-Correction Spatial-Downscaling (BCSD) Method
               and Scripts on the NMME and CFSv2 Forecast Datasets

  - This step preprocesses CFSv2 (non-precip) and 6 separate NMME
    precipitation forecast model data for driving the models offline in LIS.
    The forecasts are for the 557WW ~25 KM Global domain, bias-corrected
    using the USAF-LIS7.5-S2S (NAFPA precipitation) dataset, and covers
    up to 9 months of forecast input data to LIS.

  - 13 high-level scripts (1 main and 12 individual task scripts) to create
    bias-corrected and downscaled forecast forcings.

  - Scripts located in:  bcsd_fcst

    - main_forecast.py

      Calls:
      - forecast_task_[01-12].py
      - check_preprocess_forecast_files.py

  - Instructions can be found in the README file for hi-level scripts

  - Submit sequence of each task individually via:

     python main_forecast.py

  - Note: "forecast_task_02.py" script is for downloading the forcing
     datasets, like NMME forecast data. If data subscriptions are in
     place outside of this step, then this script can be commented out
     in the "main_forecast.py" script.


5. lis_fcst:  Running the LIS Forecast Step

  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 land surface model and the
    HyMAP2 routing model in LIS using 24-member bias-corrected CFSv2 forcing
    (one of the six NMME models) for the ~25KM S2S Global domain in
    "forecast" run-mode.

  - 1 script to produce LIS forecast configs/sbatch script files and submits
    LIS runs for all six NMME models' precipitation forecast inputs.

  - Script located in:  lis_fcst

    - generate_s2sglobal_fcst_config_scriptfiles.py <== Main script

  - Set working directory in the lisda.cfg file. Each model needs to be
    submitted individually and must be included from this list:

     CCM4, CCSM4, CFSv2, GEOSv2, GFDL, GNEMO

  - Generate and submit each LIS forecast model individually via:

   python generate_s2sglobal_fcst_config_scriptfiles.py MODEL_NAME


6. s2spost:  S2S Forecast Output Post-Process Step

  - This step automates the conversion of LIS S2S-Global forecast output
    into daily and monthly netCDF4 files and ensures they are in CF-1.8
    convention.

  - 5 scripts to combine SURFACEMODEL and RUNOFF LIS netCDF files into
    daily and monthly netCDF files in CF-1.8 convention; runtime option for
    consolidating CF files into single output directory (for downstream users).

  - Requires NetCDF Operators (NCO) utilities. Configured for Discover.

  - Scripts located in:  s2spost

     run_s2spost_9months.py:   <== Top-level python script
       run_s2spost_1month.sh:   <== Batch job script
         run_s2spost_1month.py:
           daily_s2spost_nc.py
             monthly_s2spost_nc.py

  - README file provided in the above directory that further describes the
    set of and sequence of scripts above.

  - To run the suite of scripts above, they can be initiated with:

  /absolute/path/to/run_s2spost_9months.py ldt_file topdatadir 202110 \
     nmme_forcing [--collect_output]


7. s2smetric:  S2S Forecast Metric Post-Process Step

  - The following set of scripts processes metrics for individual
    NMME model's LIS-based hydrologic monthly forecasts out to 9 months for
    a given month and year's initial condition.

  - The scripts read in the monthly post-processed files from Step #7
    above.

  - Final set of scripts convert the intermediate-based metric (netcdf) files
    to CF-1.8 convention, and merges the output into a single file.

  - 8 scripts to calculate metrics (anomalies, std anomalies), convert into
    CF-1.8 netCDF4 files, and create GeoTIFFs of medians.

  - Requires NetCDF Operators (NCO) utilities. Configured for Discover.

  - Scripts located in:  s2smetric

   - postprocess_nmme_job.py:  
     calls:
     - run_generate_metrics.sh:   <== Batch job script
       lib_bcsd_metrics/convert_dyn_fcst_to_anom.py:
       lib_bcsd_metrics/convert_dyn_fcst_to_sanom.py:
           lib_bcsd_metrics/metricslib.py
     - convert_s2s_anom_cf.py
     - merge_s2s_anom_cf.py
