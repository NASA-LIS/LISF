When opening the LIS-MIT worksheet, Excel pops out a dialog window with the following message. 

This workbook contains macros. Do you want to disable macros before opening the file?
Macros may contain viruses that could be harmful to your computer. If this file is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros. If you do not fully trust the source, click Disable Macros.

Don't worry about the macros, which are the VBA (Visual Basic for Application) code of LIS-MIT. Please click the button "Enable Macros", and then there will be an "Add-ins" tab shown up after the worksheet is opened. The "Add-ins" tab includes all LIS-MIT command buttons for generating model implementation code.  

For checking the LIS-MIT code, please take the following steps:
(1) click the Excel "Tools" menu
(2) click submenu "Macros"
(3) click submenu "Visual Basic Editor" 

The use case of Noah-MP (version 4.0.1) is included as an example.
