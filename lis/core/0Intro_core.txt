!LIS core, the central part of the software, is the infrastructure
!that integrates the use of different components in LIS.  The functions
!performed by LIS core include operations related to the overall
!control, runtime statistics, inter-language support, error logging
!and dynamic memory management functions. Routines to manage domain
!decomposition, load balancing, fault tolerance, etc. are also
!encapsulated as generic routines in the high performance computing
!and communications (HPCC) component.  The time management tools in
!LIS provides useful functions for time and data calculations and
!higher level functions to control model timestepping and alarms.
!Another tool implemented in the LIS core structure is the generic
!I/O tool, which provides capabilities to read the input data locally,
!handling different data formats.  also provide support for distributed
!data output and multiple formats. Other miscellaneous tools
!incorporated in the LIS core include methods to perform spatial and
!temporal interpolation, reprojection, domain subsetting etc.  The
!abstractions providing representations for the behavior of LSMs,
!domains, and data, runmodes, and data assimilation are also
!incorporated in the LIS core.
