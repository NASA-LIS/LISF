  FEWS-NET Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) Testcase Documentation

This test-case performs a GeoWRSI v2.0 model simulation over Eastern Africa
for one growing season (October-February timeframe), using CPC RFE2 
precipitation and USGS-based PET forcing fields.  Information about the GeoWRSI
model can be found here:  http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/tools/geowrsi/index.html

This is a test case that uses:

  (a) the GeoWRSI 2.0 crop land surface model
  (b) using CPC RFE2 precipitation and USGS PET forcing
  (c) runs over specific Easter Africa region domain
  (d) The domain is on a lat-lon grid with 0.10 deg resolution
  (e) The simulation is from 1 Jun, 2009 (00Z), to 30 Jun, 2010 (00Z), with dekad timestep
  (f) The crop type is maize.

This directory contains: 

  (a) This README file
  (b) The "ldt.config" file to generate the parameters using LDT
  (c) An "input.xdf" file used to open the LDT parameters in GrADS
  (d) The "lis.config_sos" file used for Start-of-Season (SOS) run testcase
  (e) The "lis.config_wrsi" file used for WRSI run testcase
  (f) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables
  (g) A wget download script of necessary input and output files to run
      this LDT and LIS-7 testcase:  wget_testcasefiles_portal.sh
  (h) Files: output_sos.ctl, output_sosa.ctl, and output_wrsi.ctl, are
      used to display the output in GrADS from the LIS runs
  (i) Files: testcase_sos.ctl, testcase_sosa.ctl, and testcase_wrsi.ctl, are
      used to display the packaged output in GrADS from the OUTPUT tar
      file provided for the testcase.

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Run the wget download script to obtain the input and output files
  needed to run this FEWSNET - GeoWRSI2.0 LSM test case:
  sh wget_testcasefiles_portal.sh
* Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config
  files and the sample input data. 
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
  input data.  Two LIS run-time steps are required:
  1) Run the SOS mode.  This mode is run first to process the forcing data to
   determine the start of season (SOS) and start of season anomaly
   (SOSa).
  2) Run the WRSI mode.  This mode models the crop of interest to compute the water
   requirement satisfaction index (WRSI).
* View the binary output using the sample GrADS control file. 

----

To run the CalcSOS mode step:

* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config_sos and MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL
  files.
* View the binary output using the sample grads file.  Compare against
  the sample output corresponding to "GeoWRSI2.0 LSM TEST".

To run the WRSI mode step:

* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config_wrsi and MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL
  files.
* View the binary output using the sample grads file.  Compare against
  the sample output corresponding to "GeoWRSI2.0 LSM TEST".

----

Notes:

* It is preferable to remove the SURFACEMODEL output files generated during
  the SOS run mode before running the WRSI one. 

* The 2D parameter files for the GeoWRSI 2.0 model are originally found in
 the Windows version available from:  
  http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/tools/geowrsi/index.html

Caveats:

* Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
  from this test case should not be used for any scientific evaluation.
