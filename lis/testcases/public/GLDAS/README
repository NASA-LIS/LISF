=================================
GLDAS VIC 4.1.2.l Public Testcase
=================================

Introduction
============

This is a test case that uses: 

  * the Princeton forcing 
  * using the bilinear Interpolation
  * uses the lapse-rate based elevation correction using GTOPO30 
    elevation data
  * VIC version 4.1.2.1 land surface model
  * Global domain (180W-180E; 56S-85N) at 1 degree spatial resolution.
  * a time period from Feb 1 1948, hr 1 to Feb 3, 1948, hr 1 
  * using vegetation tiling

This directory contains: 

  * This README file, 
  * the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
    edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
    forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  * A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
    output. (output.ctl)

Preparation
===========

  #. Generate the LDT and the LIS executables

  #. Create a directory to run LDT and LIS within (a directory outside
     of the LIS source code).  Copy the contents of this testcase
     sub-directory into this new running directory.  And then change
     directories into this new running directory.

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and make the "wget" .sh
     scripts be executable.


Running the GLDAS VIC 4.1.2.l testcase
======================================

LDT
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download input parameters ::

       ./wget_lisvicparms_portal.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file.

LIS
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download Princeton meteorological forcing data ::

       ./wget_princeton_portal.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LIS executable using the lis.config file

  #. View the binary output using the testcase GrADS ctl files


       
Sample Output
=============

To download sample output for comparison, make sure that you are in the
running directory.  Then execute ::

   ./wget_output_portal.sh

This will download and unpack the sample output into the "OUTPUT"
directory along side the output that you generated.


Caveats 
========

  * Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
    from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
    evaluation. 
  * Due to large matrix size created with the vegetation and elevation bands, 
    writing and reading a restart file takes considerably long time (e.g. 60
    min).  It is recommended to set the restart output interval to the least
    frequent, "1mo".
