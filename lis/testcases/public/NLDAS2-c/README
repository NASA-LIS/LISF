=================================
NLDAS2-c Sac-HTET Public Testcase
=================================

Introduction
============

This is a test case that uses: 

  * the NLDAS2 forcing 
  * using the nearest neighbor interpolation
  * RDHM 3.5.6 land surface model
  * the NLDAS domain at 1/8th-degree and NLDAS-2 forcing
  * a time period from Jan 1, 1995, 0z through Dec 31, 1995, 23z.

This directory contains: 

  * This README file, 
  * the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
    edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
    forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  * A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
    output. (output.ctl)

Preparation
===========

  #. Generate the LIS executable.

  #. Create a directory to run LDT and LIS within (a directory outside
     of the LIS source code).  Copy the contents of this testcase
     sub-directory into this new running directory.  And then change
     directories into this new running directory.

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and make the "wget" .sh
     scripts be executable.


Running the NLDAS2-c testcase
=============================


LIS
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download input parameters ::

       ./wget_input_portal.sh

     * download NLDAS2 meteorological forcing data ::

       ./wget_gesdisc_nldas2.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LIS executable using the lis.config file

  #. View the binary output using the testcase GrADS ctl files


       
Sample Output
=============

To download sample output for comparison, make sure that you are in the
running directory.  Then execute ::

   ./wget_output_portal.sh

This will download and unpack the sample output into the "OUTPUT"
directory along side the output that you generated.


Caveats 
========

  * Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
    from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
    evaluation. 
  * Please note that you may notice that soil temperature at some grid
    boxes (along coast lines or rivers) have abnormally high soil
    temperature. This is due to parameter resampling. When Sac-HTET
    parameters were resampled for use by LIS, water pixels were
    included, which Sac-HTET cannot deal with. When an NLDAS grid
    includes a water area, the resampled parameters are not right. This
    causes abnormally high soil temperature output at those water pixels.
