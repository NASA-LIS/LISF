==================================
Forecast (ESPconv) Public Testcase
==================================


Introduction
============

This is a testcase that uses:

  * the NLDAS domain at 1/8th-degree and NLDAS-2 forcing
  * the Noah version 3.3 land surface model
  * the forecast runmode: Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP)
    conventional method 
  * a time period from 00:00Z 01 Jun 2010 to 00:00Z 03 Jun 2010


This directory contains:

  * This README file

  * "ldt.config" file and input parameters to generate input file to LIS

  * Some "input.xdf" files used to open the LDT parameters in GrADS

    * input.noah33_params.xdf = GrADS XDF file for Noah.3.3

  * The "lis.config" file used for this testcase

    * lis.config.fcst_espconv.noah33 = ESP conventional forecast case

  * The "NOAH33_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config files
    to select the output variables

  * Other support ".txt" files needed for the simulations

    * forcing_variables.txt

  * Some "output.xdf" files used to display the output in GrADS

    * output.test_espconv.noah33.xdf = Noah.3.3 ESP forecast test output
    * output.orig_espconv.noah33.xdf = Noah.3.3 ESP forecast original output

Note that the "ldt.config" and "lis.config" files should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.


Preparation
===========

  #. Generate the LDT and the LIS executables.

  #. Create a directory to run LDT and LIS within (a directory outside
     of the LIS source code).  Copy the contents of this testcase
     sub-directory into this new running directory.  And then change
     directories into this new running directory.

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and make the "wget" .sh
     scripts be executable.


Running the ESP conventional testcase
=====================================

Step 1. LDT
-----------

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download input parameters for forecast scenario ::

       ./wget_noah2dparms_native.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file.


Step 2. LIS
-----------

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download Noah 3.3 specific parameter tables ::

       ./wget_noah33parms_portal.sh
       
     * download NLDAS-2 meteorological forcing data ::

       ./wget_gesdisc_nldas2_espconv.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)

  #. Run the forecast scenario by running the LIS executable
     using the lis.config.fcst_espconv.noah33 file.

  #. View the netCDF output using the testcase GrADS XDF files


Sample Output
=============

To download sample output for comparison, make sure that you are in the
running directory.  Then execute ::

   ./wget_output_portal.sh

This will download and unpack the sample output into the "output"
directory along side the output that you generated.


Caveats
=======

  * Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
    from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
    evaluation.
