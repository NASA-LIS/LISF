============================
LIS OPTimization and Uncertainty Estimation (LIS-OPTUE) and LIS-RTM Subsystem
Public Testcase
============================


Introduction
============

This is a testcase that conducts parameter estimation (PE) 
jointly for an LSM and RTM.  It uses:
	*the Noah 3.3 LSM
	*the CMEM RTM
	*1/4 degree grid of the Southern Great Plains (SGP)
	*a calibration period from 2008-04-01 to 2008-09-30
	*NLDAS2 forcing data
	* A genetic algorithm (GA) as the search algorithm
	*AMSR-E microwave emissivity retrievals calibration dataset
	 developed by Sarah Ringerud at Colorado State University
	*Least squares (LS) objective function
	(two AMSR-E channels equally weighted: 10.65V, 10.65V)

This directory contains:

  * This README file

  * An "ldt.config" file to generate the parameters using LDT

  * An "input.xdf" files used to open the LDT parameters in GrADS

  * A "lis.config" files used for this testcase

  * The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config files
    to select the output variables

  * "decision space" files specifying parameter lower and upper bounds
      *noah_dec_space.txt
      *cmem_dec_space.txt

  * Support files related to the PE LS objective function
    * LS_weight.txt that specifies the weights to be placed on each objective
    * A AMSRE_SR_attribs.txt that specifies attributes of the calibration dataset

  * RTM support files
    *amsre-freqs.txt that specifies the frequencies at which to run CMEM

  * Other support ".txt" files needed for the simulations

    * forcing_attribs.txt
    * forcing_variables.txt

  * An "output.ctl" file used to display the output in GrADS

Note that the "ldt.config" and "lis.config" files should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.


Preparation
===========

  #. Generate the LDT executable

  #. Compile LIS with CMEM ENABLED to generate the LIS executable

  #. Create a directory to run LDT and LIS within (a directory outside
     of the LIS source code).  Copy the contents of this testcase
     sub-directory into this new running directory.  And then change
     directories into this new running directory.

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and make the "wget" .sh
     scripts be executable.


Running the LIS-OPT/UE and RTM Public Testcase
=================================

LDT
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download input parameters for both open loop scenarios ::

       ./wget_lis_lai_25KM_portal.sh
       ./wget_lis_soilfrac_1KM_portal.sh
       ./wget_noah2dparms_native.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LDT executable using the ldt.config

  #. View the input using the testcase GrADS input.xdf file

LIS
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download Noah 3.3 specific parameter tables ::

       ./wget_noah33parms_portal.sh
       
     * download NLDAS-2 meteorological forcing data ::

       ./wget_gesdisc_nldas2.sh

     * download calibration data (AMSR-E emissivity)  ::

       ./wget_lis_AMSRE_emissivity_obs_portal.sh

  #. Run the LIS executable using the lis.config

  #. View the output using the  
      Grads output.xdf file provided

  #. Download OUTPUT to match against  ::

       ./wget_lis_OUTPUT_portal.sh

  #. Compare your output to that downloaded. 

Caveats
=======

  * Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
    from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
    evaluation.
