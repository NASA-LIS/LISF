International Date Line (IDL) Domain Testcase

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) The latlon projection 
  (b) A domain that crosses the International Date Line
  (c) The Noah version 3.6 land surface model
  (d) MERRA2 forcing files
  (e) Domain that covers eastern Australia and New Zealand,
       with a 11 km spatial resolution
  (f) A time period from 01:00Z 1 Jan 2001 to 01:00Z 3 Jan 2001

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) The "ldt.config" file to generate the parameters using LDT
  (c) An "input.xdf" file used to open the LDT parameters in GrADS
  (d) The "lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (e) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables
  (f) An "output.ctl" file used to display the output in GrADS from
      the LIS run
  (g) A "testcase.ctl" file used to display the packaged output in
      GrADS from the OUTPUT tar file provided by the testcase

To run this testcase:
  (a) Generate the LDT and the LIS executables and copy to local 
      working directory
  (b) Run the LDT executable using the "ldt.config" file and the
      file with the testcase input data
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the "lis.config" file with the
      testcase input data
  (d) View the netcdf output using the testcase GrADS files

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
