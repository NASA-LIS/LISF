This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GDAS forcing 
  (b) using the bilinear Interpolation
  (c) uses no elevation correction
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Domain near the Southern Great Plains (SGP) at 1/4 degree 
      spatial resolution in polar stereographic projection
  (f) a time period from Oct 29 2002, hr 1 to Oct 31, 2002, hr 1 (This 
      period is chosen since GDAS switches resolution on Oct 29, hr 12) 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file. 
       
Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that the sample grads control file does not plot the 
      output data in the polar stereographic map projection. 
      It is intended to be a description of the spatial and temporal extents.
