Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Precipitation - Southwest US Reader Testcase

This test case performs a 0.01 degree simulation over the southwest US with the
Noah-MP land surface model from 2011-09-27 through 2011-11-01 using MRMS
and NLDAS-2 forcing. This test case also demonstrates the masking/no masking feature,
in which the user can specify a tolerable value of Radar Quality Index above which to
use MRMS and below which to use an alternate forcing. Test cases are provided for mask
on and mask off cases.

NOTE: ecCodes MUST be used when running with MRMS files. Do not use the GRIB API
      libraries.

This directory contains: 

* this README file.
* two lis.config files used for this test case. (These files should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file used to specify the output variables.
* a sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  files generated by LDT. (input.ctl)
* two sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  test case outputs. (output*.ctl)

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
  input data. 
* View the binary output using the sample grads file.
