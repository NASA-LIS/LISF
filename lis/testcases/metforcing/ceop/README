This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GDAS forcing and CEOP station data at SGP as the supplemental forcing
  (b) using the bilinear Interpolation
  (c) uses the lapse-rate based elevation correction using GTOPO30 
      elevation data
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Domain near the Southern Great Plains (SGP) at 1/4 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Jul 1 2001, hr 1 to Jul 2, 2001, hr 1 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Download the sample input data from: 
	http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
      the testcase corresponding to CEOP station data FORCING TEST
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (d) View the binary output using the sample grads file. 
  (e) The output can be contrasted with the output from using only 
      GDAS forcing for impacts of using the CEOP station data. 

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that the station data spatial interpolators currently 
      are designed to work only on a single processor. Please contact 
      the LIS team if you are interested in extending this to work in 
      a multiprocessor setup.
