This README describes the RFE2-GDAS precipitation forcing reader
test case.

This directory contains:

* README
     this README file
* lis.config
     LIS configuration file
* MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL
     output specification file
* output.ctl
     GrADS descriptor file for the user-generated output
* testcase.ctl
     GrADS descriptor file for the supplied test case output


This is a test case that uses: 

* the RFE2-GDAS disaggregated precipitation forcing 
* using conservative interpolation
* uses no elevation correction
* the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
  outputs the interpolated forcing data
* East African domain at 10 km spatial resolution
* a time period from Oct 1, 2008, hr 6 to Oct 3, 2009, hr 18


To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Download the sample input data from: 
  http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
  the testcase corresponding to "RFE2-GDAS Precipitation FORCING" test case.
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
  input data. 
* View the binary output using the sample grads file.  Compare against
  the sample output corresponding to "RFE2-GDAS Precipitation FORCING" test
  case.


Note that results were verified by summing the hourly results into daily
totals and comparing those daily totals against the input forcing.
       

Caveats: 

* Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
  from the test case is not expected to be used for any scientific 
  evaluation.
