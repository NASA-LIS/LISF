This README describes the RFE2-GDAS precipitation forcing reader
test case.

This directory contains:

* README
     this README file
* lis.config
     LIS configuration file
* MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL
     output specification file
* output.ctl
     GrADS descriptor file for the user-generated output
* testcase.ctl
     GrADS descriptor file for the supplied test case output

This is a test case that uses: 

* the RFE2-GDAS disaggregated precipitation forcing 
* using conservative interpolation
* uses no elevation correction
* the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
  outputs the interpolated forcing data
* East African domain at 10 km spatial resolution
* a time period from Oct 1, 2008, hr 6 to Oct 3, 2009, hr 18


To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
  input data. 
* View the binary output using the sample grads file. 

Note that results were verified by summing the hourly results into daily
totals and comparing those daily totals against the input forcing.
       

Caveats: 

* Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
  from the test case is not expected to be used for any scientific 
  evaluation.
