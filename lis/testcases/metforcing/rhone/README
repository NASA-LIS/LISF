This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the Rhone AGG forcing 
  (b) uses no spatial interpolation
  (c) does not use elevation correction
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Rhone AGG domain at 1 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Sep 1, 1985 to Sep 4, 1985. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Download the sample input data from: 
	http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
      the testcase corresponding to Rhone-AGG FORCING TEST
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (d) View the binary output using the sample grads file. 

Caveats: 
  (a) Currently spatial interpolation of the Rhone-AGG forcing is not 
      implemented. As a result, this forcing cannot be used at 
      spatial resolutions other than 1 deg.
