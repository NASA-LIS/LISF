The USGS PET Reader Test Case for LIS v7.0

This test-case performs a global 0.10 degree simulation with the
TEMPLATE lsm option from Jan. 31 to Apr. 1, 2004 to test the processing of
daily 1.0 degree USGS PET data (*bil format).


This directory contains the following files and directories:

 -- lis.config:  LIS config file that contains needed requirements for: 
    -- running with the USGS PET dataset and
    -- generating the output found in the OUTPUT directory (EXP111)
    -- USGS PET read in as a supplemental forcing dataset
    -- Uses nearest neighbor (NN) approach for the spatial interpolation

 -- forcing_variables.txt:  Contains the list of forcing variables, including
       the PET types used by the reader.

 -- MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL:  Includes the total PET and other WRSI model variables 
       (that could be written out if run with WRSI).

 -- output.ctl:  GrADS Control file provided for reading the output of EXP111.

 -- testcase.ctl:  GrADS Control file provided for reading the output of EXP111.


To run this test case: 

 -- Generate the LIS executable. 
 -- Download the sample input data from: 
    http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
    the testcase corresponding to "USGS PET FORCING" test case.
 -- Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
    input data. 
 -- View the binary output using the sample grads file.  Compare against
    the sample output corresponding to "USGS PET FORCING" test
    case.

     availability, please see:

Caveats: 

* Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
  from the test case is not expected to be used for any scientific 
  evaluation.
