This testcase is for the NLDAS-2 netCDF-4 metforcing plugin in LIS.

This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the NLDAS2 forcing 
  (b) using the Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
  (c) uses no elevation correction (This is built into the forcing data). 
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) North American domain at 1/8 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from 2 Jan 1979 at 14Z to 2 Jan 1979 at 20Z.

There are 4 lis.config files in this directory:

lis.config.nldas.grib         = Standard NLDAS-2 GRIB-1 forcing
lis.config.nldas.grib.FORB    = NLDAS-2 GRIB-1 forcing, also using
                                "FORB" secondary forcing
lis.config.nldas.netcdf       = Standard NLDAS-2 netCDF-4 forcing
lis.config.nldas.netcdf.FORB  = NLDAS-2 netCDF-4 forcing, also using
                                "FORB" secondary forcing

Note that the "FORB" lis.config files use separate files for
forcing_variables and for the MODEL OUTPUT TBL.  These files
are also provided and include "FORB" in the filename.

Only the lis.config "netcdf" files truly need to be tested with this
pull request.  The "grib" output is also provided as further comparison.
Note that because the input GRIB-1 and netCDF-4 NLDAS-2 data are not
binary identical (with very slight differences due to rounding), the
"grib" and "netcdf" output will also have very small rounding
differences between them.
