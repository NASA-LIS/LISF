GEFS Meteorological Forcing Reader - Operational @ 0.5 deg

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) Latlon grid  
  (b) A domain spanning Minnesota to Utah
  (c) The Noah version 3.6 land surface model
  (d) GEFS operational forcing files
  (e) A time period from 00:00Z 1 Jan 2022 to 00:00Z 2 Jan 2022
  (f) 3-hourly output files, written as NetCDF

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) An "input.ctl" file used to open the LDT parameters in GrADS
  (c) The "lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (d) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables
  (e) An "output.ctl" file used to display the output in GrADS from
      the LIS run
  (f) A "testcase.ctl" file used to display the packaged output in
      GrADS from the OUTPUT tar file provided by the testcase

To run this testcase:
  (a) Run the LIS executable using the "lis.config" file with the
      testcase input data
  (b) View the netcdf output using the testcase GrADS files

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
