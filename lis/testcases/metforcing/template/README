This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the template forcing; i.e, no forcing
  (b) the template LSM option
  (c) North American domain at 1/4 degree spatial resolution.
  (d) a time period from Oct 29 2002, hr 1 to Oct 31, 2002, hr 1

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file.
