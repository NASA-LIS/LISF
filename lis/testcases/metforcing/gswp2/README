This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GSWP forcing 
  (b) using the bilinear Interpolation
  (c) uses no elevation correction (currently this feature is not implemented
      for GSWP forcing)
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Global domain at 1 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Jan 1, 1987 hr 1 to Jan 2, hr 1. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable, with the NETCEF option turned on. 
      (edit the misc.h file in the make directory, and make sure 
      that USE_NETCDF is specified as 'defined', before you compile
      the LIS code)
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file.
