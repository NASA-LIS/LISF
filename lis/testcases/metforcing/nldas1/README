This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the NLDAS forcing 
  (b) using the Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
  (c) removes the built-in NLDAS elevation correction and enables the use of 
      specified elevation data (such as from GTOPO30), and
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) North American domain at 1/8 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Dec 31, 2000, hr 23 to Jan 2, 2001, hr 1. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file.
