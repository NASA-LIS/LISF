GEOS5 Forecast Reader Test Case

This test-case performs a 1/4 degree simulation over the Horn of Africa
(lat -11.125 to 24.375, lon 21.125 to 51.625) with the
Catchment Fortuna 2.5 lsm from 2011-01-01T01:00:00 to 2011-01-31T00:00:00
to test the processing of the GEOS5 forecast forcing data.

This directory contains: 

* this README file.
* the ldt.config file used to generate the LIS input parameter file (lis_input.d01.nc).
* the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file used to specify the output variables.


To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
  input data. 
* Compare output against the provided sample output.

Notes:

The spatial and temporal resolutions of the GEOS5 forecast meteorological
forcings are 1.25X1-deg and 1-hour. Any bias correction required on the
meteorological forcing data must be done out-side of LIS7.  GEOS5 forecasts are
produced by initializing GEOS5 model each month from 1981 to 2013 and run for 9
months into the future.

There is a bit if pre-processing work required in arranging the meteorological
forcings.  See an example below about how this arrangement must be done:

Let's say you need hydrological forecasts for 9 months starting January of 2011
(lets write it as 201101, the last two digits represent the month).

Step 1) LIS7 reader looks for directories 201101,201102,201103, ....., 201109.

Step 2) In each of the directores, there must be sub-directories for each
        eneseble member, lets say you have 7 ensemble members, then the
        sub-direcrtories should have names ens1, ens2, ...., ens7.

Step3) Each ensemble member (sub-)directory should contain the forcing files
       bearing names indicating (i) when was it initialized, and (ii)
       year-month-day-hourly time stamp. An example of acceptable file name is:
       "jan01.geosgcm_surfh.20110131_2330z.nc4", where 'jan01' indicates
       initialized month, '20110131_2330z' indicates year-month-day-hourly
       time stamp.

Post-processing:

The output is created as a vector (1-d tile space), but not as a spatial map
(2-d grid).  This 1-d vector output is required if we want to analyze the
outputs produced by different ensembles.  Note that if you choose
"Output methodology" to be '2-d grid' then you will get output of
ensemble-mean, not for individual ensembles.
