This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the ECMWF Reanalysis forcing 
  (b) using the bilinear interpolation
  (c) applies lapse-rate based elevation correction to the forcing data
      using the GTOPO30 based LIS elevation data. 
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Global domain at 1/4 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Jan 10, 1987, hr 1 to Jan 11, 1987, hr 1. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file.
