This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GEOS forcing 
  (b) using the bilinear Interpolation
  (c) uses no elevation correction (currently this feature is not implemented
      for GEOS forcing)
  (d) the "template" LSM option (which is a dummy LSM placeholder that simply
      outputs the interpolated forcing data. 
  (e) Globl domain at 1/4 degree spatial resolution.
  (f) a time period from Sep 30, 2002, hr 1 to Oct 2, 2002, hr 1. During this
      period, the GEOS data switches to a higher native resolution (GEOS3 to 
      GEOS4), which occurs automatically in the LIS code. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) forcing_variables_v2.txt file used to specify the list of variables
      in the GEOS forcing data
  (d) MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file which specifies the LIS model output 
      configuration for this testcase
  (e) A sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Download the sample input data from: 
	http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
      the testcase corresponding to GEOS FORCING TEST
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (d) View the binary output using the sample grads file.
