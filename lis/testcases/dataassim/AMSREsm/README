To run AMSR-E soil moisture data assimilation with Noah:

1) Set the following entries in lis.config (a sample of lis.config can
be found from /discover/nobackup/bli/lis5.0/run/lis.config.amsre):

Number of ensembles per tile:

Assimilation algorithm: 2         
Assimilation set: 9  
Number of state variables:  4
Number of observation types: 1

Forcing perturbation algorithm:            
Observation perturbation algorithm:        
State perturbation algorithm:             2   
Forcing perturbation frequency:            3600
Observation perturbation frequency:       3600
State perturbation frequency:             3600
Number of forcing fields to be perturbed: 3

Forcing attributes file:                      
Forcing perturbation attributes file:         
State attributes file:                        
State perturbation attributes file:           
Observation attributes file:                  
Observation perturbation attributes file:

AMSR-E Soil Moisture data directory: 
AMSR-E and Noah CDF file directory: 
CDF levels: 

2) Store CDF and CDF levels files in the directory specified in
lis.config.  These files need to be named noah_cdf.sqr4, amsr_cdf.sqr4,
cdf_levs.txt respectively.  Samples of these files can be found from
/discover/nobackup/bli/lis5.0/run/. Note these sample files are for the
specified domain in lis.config.amsre and the number of CDF levels given
in lis.config.amsre only.

3) Run LIS.
