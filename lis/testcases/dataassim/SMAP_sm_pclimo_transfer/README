Noah-MP.4.0.1 SMAP Assimilation with Relocated CDF

This case demonstrates EnKF-based assimilation of NASA SMAP data into
Noah-MP.4.0.1 LSM using relocated CDFs

It uses:
* MERRA2
* Retrospective run mode
* Noah-MP.4.0.1 LSM
* Regional domain over Europe
* Time period from 1 June 2020 to 1 Jan 2022.

This directory contains:
* This README file
* The lis.config file used for this test case
* The NOAHMP36_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL.dyn.full file used by lis.config to select
  the output variables.

Note that lis.config should be edited to make sure the locations of the
parameter and forcing files are specified correctly.

To run this testcase:
* Compile LIS
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the testcase input
  data.
