This directory contains:
* this README file
* the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file used to specify the output variables.
* a sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  output. (output.ctl)
* a sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  test case output. (testcase.ctl)
* output-routing.ctl
* testcase-routing.ctl

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
  input data.
