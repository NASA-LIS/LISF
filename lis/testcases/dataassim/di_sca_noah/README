This testcase demonstrates the use of rule-based Direct Insertion (DI) 
(Rodell and Houser, 2004) to assimilate snow cover area (SCA) observations
using Noah land surface model. The SCA observations in this case is 
generated using the Catchment LSM, from a separate simulation. 

The testcase uses 
  (a) a domain that spans North America 
  (b) a time period from Jan 1 2004, hr 1 to Jan 31, 2004, hr 1. 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) two lis.config files: (lis.config.openloop - that can be used
      to conduct the openloop simulations, and lis.config.assim that 
      can be used for the assimilation run of SCA observations using 
      rule-based DI. (These file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) Sample grads control files that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (openloop.ctl and assim.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Conduct the openloop simulation : copy lis.config.openloop to 
      lis.config and run the LIS executable
  (c) Conduct the assimilation simulation: copy the lis.config.assim to 
      lis.config and run the LIS executable
  (d) View the binary output using the sample grads files. 

The inupt data includes the required parameter and forcing files. 
In addition, the input data also includes the SCA observations, as
well as the Control/Truth data (which is basically the output of 
a separate simulation using the Catchment LSM). Sample grads files
are provided along with these data that describes the spatial/temporal
extent and the order of variables. The data download page also 
provides some sample time series plots that demonstrates the impact of 
assimilation on the snow fields.
