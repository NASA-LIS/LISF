This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GDAS forcing 
  (b) using the bilinear Interpolation
  (c) uses no elevation correction
  (d) Noah version 2.7.1 land surface model
  (e) North American domain at 1/4 degree spatial resolution, 
      and global 1 degree resolution simultaneously with the use of nesting
      capabilities.
  (f) a time period from Oct 29 2002, hr 1 to Oct 31, 2002, hr 1 (This 
      period is chosen since GDAS switches resolution on Oct 29, hr 12) 

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) the lis.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) Sample grads control files that can be used to visualize the 
      output. (output1.ctl and output2.ctl)

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and your sample 
      input data. 
  (c) View the binary output using the sample grads file. 
       
Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
      evaluation.
