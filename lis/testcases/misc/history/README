This is a test case that uses: 
  (a) the GDAS forcing 
  (b) with bilinear interpolation
  (c) with elevation correction
  (d) template land surface model
  (e) a time period from Oct 29 2002, hr 0 to Oct 29, 2002, hr 2.

This directory contains: 
  (a) This README file, 
  (b) four lis.config files used for this test case. (These files should be 
      edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
      forcing files are specified correctly.) 
  (c) Sample grads control files that can be used to visualize the 
      output.
  (d) template_main.F90 file.  This file replaces the template_main.F90
      file located in lsms/template/.

To run this test case: 
  (a) Generate the LIS executable. 
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
      input data. 
  (c) Compare the results against the testcase results contained the OUTPUT
      directory or compare the results against the values documented in the
      template_main.F90 file.

Notes:
   (a) This testcase is designed to test the various history support features
       provided by LIS.  In particular, it tests writing output as
       instantaneous, time averaged, or accumulated results.  It tests
       changing the direction of the output data.  It tests generating minimum
       and maximum values.  It tests computing the standard deviation of the
       output data.
   (b) To fully test the history support, four domains have been created.
       (i)   3x3 domain, 1 tile per grid, 1 ensemble per tile.
       (ii)  3x3 domain, 1 tile per grid, 2 ensembles per tile.
       (iii) 3x3 domain, 2 tiles per grid, 1 ensemble per tile.
       (iv)  3x3 domain, 2 tiles per grid, 2 ensembles per tile.
   (c) This testcase must be run four times, once per domain.
       You must copy the template_main.F90 file contained in
       testcases/misc/history/ into lsms/template/.  Select a domain by 
       setting "#if 1" for the desired domain, and setting "#if 0" for the 
       other domains.  Compile, run, and repeat.
   (d) There are four lis.config files corresponding to the four domains.
       (i)   lis.config_3x3_1_1 <--> 3x3 domain, 1 tile per grid, 1 ensemble
                                     per tile.
       (ii)  lis.config_3x3_1_2 <--> 3x3 domain, 1 tile per grid, 2 ensembles
                                     per tile.
       (iii) lis.config_3x3_2_1 <--> 3x3 domain, 2 tiles per grid, 1 ensemble
                                     per tile.
       (iv)  lis.config_3x3_2_2 <--> 3x3 domain, 2 tiles per grid, 2 ensembles
                                     per tile.
   (e) This testcase only runs as a serial process.  To test history support,
       first run this testcase and verify that the output is correct.  Then
       run another testcase, say Noah 2.7.1, both as a serial and a parallel
       process.  Verify that these two runs produced the same results.

       
Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
      evaluation.
