HyMAP3 Testcase

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) NLDAS2 grib forecast forcing
  (b) The NoahMP version 4.0.1 land surface model
  (c) Colorado river basin
  (e) A time period from 23:30Z 31 Dec 1989 to 00:15Z 1 Jan 1991

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) The "ldt.config" file used to generate the parameters using LDT
  (c) The "lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (d) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables

Note that the "ldt.config" and "lis.config" files should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.

To run this testcase:
  (a) Generate the LDT and the LIS executables
  (b) Run the LDT executable using the "ldt.config" file
      with the testcase input data
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the "lis.config" file with the
      testcase input data

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
  (b) This does not produce any surface module output, only HyMAP3 router output.
