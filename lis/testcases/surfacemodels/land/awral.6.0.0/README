TEMPLATE LSM forcing Testcase

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) The AWRAL forcing over the Australian domain at 0.05 degree spatial resolution
  (b) The awral.6.0.0 LSM option
  (c) The Australian domain at 0.05 degree spatial resolution
  (d) A time period from 00:00Z 30 Jun 2010 to 00:00Z 5 July 2010 with a restart file from 00:00Z 30 June 2010

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) The "AWRAL600.rst.lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (c) The "AWRAL600_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the AWRAL600.rst.lis.config file
      to select the output variables

Note that the "AWRAL600.rst.lis.config" files should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.

To run this testcase:
  (a) Generate the LIS executable
  (b) Download the testcase input and output data from:
         http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases
      the testcase corresponding to AWRAL 6.0 LSM TEST
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the "AWRAL600lis.rst.config" file with the
      testcase input data (E.g. mpirun -np 4 ./LIS -f AWRAL600lis.rst.config)

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
  (b) The forcing and model domain must match and be at the same resolution
  (c) The user can compare their netcdf outputs against the netcdf outputs supplied using standard climate data operator tools (E.g. cdo)
