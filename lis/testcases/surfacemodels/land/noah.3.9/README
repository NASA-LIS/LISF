Noah-3.9.1 LSM Testcase

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) The GDAS forcing
  (b) Bilinear Interpolation
  (c) Lapse-rate based elevation correction using GTOPO30 elevation data
  (d) The Noah version 3.9.1 land surface model
  (e) North American domain at 1/4 degree spatial resolution
  (f) A time period from 00:00Z 1 Oct 2002 to 01:00Z 1 Oct 2003

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) The "ldt.config" file to generate the parameters using LDT
  (c) The "lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (d) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables

Note that the "ldt.config" and "lis.config" files should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.

To run this testcase:
  (a) Generate the LDT and the LIS executables
  (b) Run the LDT executable using the "ldt.config" file 
      with the testcase input data
  (c) Run the LIS executable using the "lis.config" file with the
      testcase input data

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
