Irrigation in Noah-MP 3.6 - CONUS Testcase

This test case performs a 0.125 degree simulation over the CONUS with the 
Noah-MP land surface model from 2001-01-01 through 2002-01-01 using 
NLDAS-2 forcing data. This case demonstrates sprinkler irrigation with the 
new groundwater abstraction features. Test cases are provided for cases where
irrigation water is removed from the groundwater and where irrigation water is
provided as in the default irrigation scheme.

NOTE: Set Irrigation GVF parameter 1: 0.40 and Irrigation GVF parameter 2: 0.00 for 
      identical behavior to the Noah 3.3 irrigation scheme.
      Groundwater abstraction for irrigation: 1 denotes that irrigation water is
      removed from the groundwater.

      This update is only recommended for the default Noah/Noah-MP soil layering:
      10cm, 30cm, 60cm, 100cm. Functionality for changing the configuration of
      soil layers has not yet been added. 

This directory contains: 

* this README file.
* two lis.config files used for this test case. (These files should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file used to specify the output variables.
* a sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  files generated by LDT. (input.ctl)
* two sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  test case outputs. (output*.ctl)

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LIS executable. 
* Download the sample input data from: 
  http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Source/testcases  
  the testcase corresponding to NOAH-MP IRRIGATION
* Run the LIS executable using the lis.config file and the sample 
  input data. 
* View the binary output using the sample grads file.
