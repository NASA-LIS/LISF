JULES namelist collections.

ps41_nml_15min/ is for running JULES in PS41 configuration, with 3 snow layers.
THIS IS THE CONFIGURATION RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN OPERATIONS BY USAF.

single_snow_layer/ is for running JULES in a similar configuration, but with
only 1 snow layer.  These were used for running LIS7.3-JULES5.0
"warm-started" from UM Dump files in 2017 and 2018, which used a single
snow layer.

                  files)

initial_conditions.nml:  Edit path to 'initial_conditions.dat' (included with
                         namelist files)
