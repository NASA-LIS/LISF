!The operational, global analysis products from the European Center
!for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is available on a $T_L$511
!triangular truncation, linear reduced gaussian grid for four synoptic
!hours: 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC, which are used in LIS.  The radiation
!products from the data assimilation system at the ECMWF is based
!on the scheme simulated after Morcrette's work~\cite{morcrette}.
!The estimation of shortwave and longwave radiation includes schemes
!to include effects of adsorption by water vapor and other gases and
!aerosol scattering based on different
!parameterizations~\cite{rothman,morcrette2}.
