!This section describes the implementation of the RFE2gdas.0 rainfall
!precipitation reader.  These precipitation data are the Climate
!Prediction Center's (CPC) Rainfall Estimates version 2 (RFE2) daily data
!disaggregated to 6-hourly data using GDAS.
!
!The original daily data are available from
!ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/fews/newalgo\_est/ and \\
!ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/fews/fewsdata/africa/rfe2/
!and are used in USAID/FEWS-NET. 
!
!The CPC precip is a daily precipitation analysis at 0.1 deg lat x 0.1 deg lon
!produced by merging GTS gauge observations and  3 kinds of satellite 
!estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Units are in millimeters (mm).
!Data is in big endian binary with coverage -40.00S to 40.00N Northward
!(801 grid points in south - north direction)  and 20.00W to 55.00E 
!Eastward  (751 grid points in east - west direction)
