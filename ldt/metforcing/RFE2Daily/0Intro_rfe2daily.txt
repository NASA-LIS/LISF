!This precip is a daily precipitation analysis at 0.1 deg lat x 0.1 deg lon
!produced by merging GTS gauge observations and  3 kinds of satellite 
!estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Units are in millimeters (mm).
!Data is in big endian binary with coverage -40.00S to 40.00N Northward
!(801 grid points in south - north direction)  and 20.00W to 55.00E
