!\section{GDAS}
!The Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) is the global, operational
!weather forecast model developed at the Environmental Modeling
!Center (EMC) of NOAA/NCEP~\cite{derber}.  The radiation algorithms
!in GDAS include parameterizations for SW$\downarrow$ and LW$\downarrow$
!radiation interactions between clouds and radiation. The shortwave
!radiation parameterization follows the the scheme developed by
!\cite{chou} and the longwave radiation scheme is based on the work
!of \cite{schwarzkopf}. GDAS forcing variables are produced on a
!quadratic T170 gaussian grid. LIS uses the 00, 03, and as needed,
!the 06 (hours after current) forecasts, which are produced at 6
!hour intervals. From October 2002 onwards, the GDAS outputs are
!generated at a higher resolution T254 gaussian grid.
