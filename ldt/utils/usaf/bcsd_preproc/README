Bias Correction and Preprocessing Workflow
==============================================================================
The scripts in this directory contain the workflow for preparing and processing operational S2S forecast data for LIS over the AFRICOM domain. The main script is named:

    * Main_forecast.sh

and is used to manually call each individual task (prefixed with 'FORECAST_TASK_') to prepare CFSv2 (non-precip) and NMME (precip) forecast data as input for running hydrological forecasts in LIS using Noah-MP-4.0.1 & HyMAP2. This pre-processing workflow is divided into 4 parts and are described below.
==============================================================================

PART A: DOWNLOAD, RESCALE, AND ORGANIZE
This section involves downloading the correct forecasts, rescaling them to a unified 25 KM spatial grid, and organizing them in a format for the proceeding tasks

    * FORECAST_TASK_01.sh: Generate 6-hourly files - "SD" part; CFSv2 1Deg--> 25KM, and USAF 10KM --> 25KM; netcdf
    * FORECAST_TASK_02.sh: Download NMME Data (Note that this task has been temporarily removed as the downloading of all raw data will be handled prior to this workflow)
    * FORECAST_TASK_03.sh: Rescale and reorganize NMME Data

==============================================================================

PART B: BIAS CORRECTION
This sections involves creating monthly bias corrected data for CFSv2 (non-precip) and NMME (precip) datasets. Includes these scripts:

    * FORECAST_TASK_04.sh: Monthly "BC" step applied to CFSv2
    * FORECAST_TASK_05.sh: Monthly "BC" step applied to NMME

==============================================================================

PART C: TEMPORAL DISAGGREGATION
This section involves temporally disaggregating the monthly bias corrected forecasts generated in PART B to sub-daily (6-hourly) resolution. Includes these scripts:

    * FORECAST_TASK_06.sh: CFSv2 Temporal Disaggregation
    * FORECAST_TASK_07.sh: Generate symbolic links to sub-daily CFSv2 BC forecasts for NMME temporal disaggregation due to an uneven number of ensembles between the datasets
    * FORECAST_TASK_08.sh: NMME Temporal Disaggregation

==============================================================================

PART D: LIS PREPARATION
This section involves preparing the sub-daily bias corrected forecasts for LIS

    * FORECAST_TASK_09.sh: Combine the CFSv2 forcing fields into final format for LIS to read
    * FORECAST_TASK_10.sh: Combine the NMME forcing fields into final format for LIS to read and symbolically link to the reusable CFSv2 met forcings
    * FORECAST_TASK_11.sh: Copy 9th forecast lead file as 10th forecast lead for LIS runs
    * FORECAST_TASK_12.sh: Temporary task to introduce an all-zero variable V10M due to the way wind is handled in the USAF forcing

==============================================================================

PROCESSING CHECK
A final processing check is available to the user to check that the number of files and file size generated within this workflow meet expectations
