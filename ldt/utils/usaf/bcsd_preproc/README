The scripts in this directory contain the workflow for preparing and processing operational S2S forecast data for LIS over the AFRICOM domain. 
==============================================================================
The main script is named:

    * main_forecast.py

and is used to manually call each individual task (prefixed with 'forecast_task_') to prepare CFSv2 (non-precip) and NMME (precip) forecast data as input for running hydrological forecasts in LIS using Noah-MP-4.0.1 & HyMAP2. This pre-processing workflow is divided into 4 parts and are described below.
==============================================================================

PART A: DOWNLOAD, RESCALE, AND ORGANIZE
This section involves downloading the correct forecasts, rescaling them to a unified 25 KM spatial grid, and organizing them in a format for the proceeding tasks. Includes these scripts:

    * forecast_task_01.py: Generate 6-hourly files - "SD" part; CFSv2 1Deg--> 25KM, and USAF 10KM --> 25KM; netcdf
    * forecast_task_02.py: Download NMME Data
    * forecast_task_03.py: Rescale and reorganize NMME Data

==============================================================================

PART B: BIAS CORRECTION
This sections involves creating monthly bias corrected data for CFSv2 (non-precip) and NMME (precip) datasets. Includes these scripts:

    * forecast_task_04.py: Monthly "BC" step applied to CFSv2
    * forecast_task_05.py: Monthly "BC" step applied to NMME

==============================================================================

PART C: TEMPORAL DISAGGREGATION
This section involves temporally disaggregating the monthly bias corrected forecasts generated in PART B to sub-daily (6-hourly) resolution. Includes these scripts:

    * forecast_task_06.py: CFSv2 Temporal Disaggregation
    * forecast_task_07.py: Generate symbolic links to sub-daily CFSv2 BC forecasts for NMME temporal disaggregation due to an uneven number of ensembles between the datasets
    * forecast_task_08.py: NMME Temporal Disaggregation
==============================================================================

PART D: LIS PREPARATION
This section involves preparing the sub-daily bias corrected forecasts for LIS. Includes these scripts:

    * forecast_task_09.py: Combine the CFSv2 forcing fields into final format for LIS to read
    * forecast_task_10.py: Combine the NMME forcing fields into final format for LIS to read and symbolically link to the reusable CFSv2 met forcings
    * forecast_task_11.py: Copy 9th forecast lead file as 10th forecast lead for LIS runs
    * forecast_task_12.py: Task to introduce an all-zero variable V10M due to the way wind is handled in the USAF forcing
==============================================================================

PROCESSING CHECK
This section involves checking that the data processed correctly. Includes this script:
    * check_preprocess_forecast_files.py: A final processing check is available to the user to check that the number of files and file size generated within this workflow meet expectations
