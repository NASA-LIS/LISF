Bias Correction and Preprocessing Workflow Function Library
==============================================================================
The scripts in this directory contain the 'lower-level' run scripts and python scripts called by the 'top-level' scripts in the parent directory. These scripts prepare and process operational S2S forecast data for LIS over the AFRICOM domain. These scripts are not intended to be run individually outside of the preprocessing framework (e.g. Main_forecast.sh). These scripts can be divided into 3 categories: 

    (1) run & batch scripts
    (2) python scripts
    (3) python modules

and a description of each is provided below.
==============================================================================

RUN & BATCH SCRIPTS
These scripts involve submiting jobs on a high performance computing cluster (prefixed with 'run_') or are smaller bash scripts that can be run locally (NOT prefixed with 'run_') 

    * convert_forecast_data_to_netcdf.scr - Bash script called by 'process_forecast_data.scr' that handles the main logic of converting and handling raw CFSv2 GRIB to netcdf data
    * Copy_Precipitation_sub-daily.scr
    * process_forecast_data.scr - Bash script called by 'run_process_forecast_data.scr' that converts, merges, subsets, rescales and organizes raw CFSv2 forecast data
    * run_BCSD_calctest.scr - Batch script that runs the python script: bias_correction_modulefast.py
    * run_Combining.scr - Batch script that runs the python script: combine_sub_daily_downscaled_forcings.py
    * run_NMME_BCSD_calctest.scr  - Batch script that runs the python script: bias_correction_nmme_modulefast.py
    * run_NMME_Temporal_disagg.scr - Batch script that runs the python script: temporal_disaggregation_nmme_6hourly_module.py
    * run_process_forecast_data.scr - Batch script that runs the bash script: process_forecast_data.scr
    * run_Temporal_disagg.scr - Batch script that runs the python script: temporal_disaggregation_6hourly_module.py

==============================================================================

PYTHON SCRIPTS
These scripts handle the majority of the preprocessing workflow including: bias correction, temporal disaggregation, generating climatologies,and  preparing data for LIS input 

    * bias_correction_modulefast.py - Python script that handles all of the bias correction of CFSv2 Monthly forecast data
    * bias_correction_nmme_modulefast.py - Python script that handles all of the bias correction of NMME Monthly forecast precipitation
    * calc_and_write_forecast_climatology.py - Python script that calculates CFSv2 climatologies of the given period (default 2008-2020) from monthly data
    * calc_and_write_nmme_forecast_climatology.py - Python script that calculates NMME climatologies of the given period (default 2008-2020) from monthly precipitation data
    * calc_and_write_observational_climatology.py - Python script that calculates NAFPA (observatoinal) climatologies of the given period (default 2008-2020) from monthly data
    * combine_sub_daily_downscaled_forcings.py - Python script that prepares the sub-daily bias corrected CFSv2 data for LIS input
    * nmme_cfsv2reorg_h.py - Python script (specifcially for the hindcast setup) that generates monthly precip from raw sub-daily CFSv2 forecasts in a form similar to other downloaded monthly NMME data
    * nmme_reorg_f.py - Python script that reorganizes, rescales, and formats the downloaded raw NMME data for use in the forecast workflow
    * nmme_reorg_h.py - Python script that reorganizes, rescales, and formats the downloaded raw NMME data for use in the hindcast workflow
    * temporal_disaggregation_6hourly_module.py - Python script that handles the temporal disaggregation of monthly bias corrected CFSv2 forecast data to sub-daily bias corrected CFSv2 forecast data
    * temporal_disaggregation_nmme_6hourly_module.py - Python script that handles the temporal disaggregation of monthly bias corrected NMME forecast precipitation to sub-daily bias corrected NMME forecast precipitation

==============================================================================

PYTHON MODULES

    * All_functions.py - Python module which contains various and reusable helper functions within the python scripts above
    * BCSD_functionfast.py - Python module which contains BCSD specific functions used within the python scripts above
    * BCSD_function.py - Python module which contains BCSD specific functions used within the python scripts above
    * BCSD_stats_functions.py - Python module which contains BCSD specific functions used within the python scripts above
