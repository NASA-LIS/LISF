Noah-MP-4.0.1 S2S-AFRICOM LDT ensemble restart file generation script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following script can be used to generate the six NMME 
model-based ensemble restart files required to initialize 
the same six NMME model-based forecasts using the LDT
software for the 557WW S2S AFRICOM ~25KM domain for the 
Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM. Also, this script is designed to run as an
automated script to run in part of the near-realtime (NRT)
fashion of generating the S2S forecasts.

HyMAP2 routing model restart files are single-member at this time, so
they are copied from the LIS DA run directories during operations.

Note: Initial conditions (ICs) is interchangeable with "restart file".

Here is the script:

  generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

and the steps to run it and process the IC files include:

 1. Set your working and input directory paths in the
    given Python-based config file:

     ldt_ics.cfg

    You are setting the working directory and any
    other paths to where your input restart files are found,
    for NoahMP401 and HYMAP2.

 2. Need the following directory:  ./template_files
    and the TEMPLATE-based config file within it:

     template_files/ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_TEMPLATE

 3. Copy your LDT executable to the local directory where you
    will run this script.

 4. Run the python script as:

  ./generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

   or

   python generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

 5. The following config and output restart directories/files 
    are generated using the LDT executable, along with 
    the automated date strings required to run this in NRT.

   * The six NMME-ensemble based LDT configuration files:

    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_ccm4
    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_ccsm4
    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_cfsv2
    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_geosv2
    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_gfdl
    ldt.config_noahmp401_nmme_gnemo
 
    written to a directory named:  ldt.config_files

   * The six different LDT runs should generate six different output directories,
    one for each NMME model, and the respective output restart files will be 
    contained in the following list output directories, with varying numbers
    of ensemble members based on the NMME model:
 
     CCM4
     CCSM4
     CFSv2
     GEOSv2
     GFDL
     GNEMO
