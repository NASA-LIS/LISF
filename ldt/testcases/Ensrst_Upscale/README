Focus:  Upscaling a Single Member Restart File to an Ensemble Restart file

Description:  This case involves the upscaling or generating an ensemble restart
      file from a single member or baseline run restart file.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file 

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Select a single-member LIS model restart file, such as:
       LIS_RST_NOAH33_201212312330.d01.nc
      from your run output directory.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Modify the ldt.config file to point to your LIS model restart file.

  (d) Run the LDT executable with the provided ldt.config file by typing:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (e) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using a tool, like
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
