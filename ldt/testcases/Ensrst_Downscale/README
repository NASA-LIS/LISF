Focus:  Downscaling Ensemble Restart File to Single Member Restart File

Description:  This case involves the downscaling or generating a single-member
     restart file from a ensemble-member restart file.


This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file used by LDT 

To run such a case: 
 
  (a) Obtain an ensemble-based restart file from one of your LIS 
      model run directories, such as:
        LIS_RST_NOAH33_201212312330.d01.nc

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Modify the ldt.config file provided for your case.

  (d) Run the LDT executable with the provided ldt.config file by typing:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (e) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using a tool, like
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
