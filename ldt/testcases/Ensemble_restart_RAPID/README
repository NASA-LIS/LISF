Ensemble restart processing for RAPID


This case proccesses a single member RAPID router restart file to produce
an 18 member RAPID router restart file.  This is for a 10 km global domain.


This test case uses the following files:
(a) this README file
(b) the ldt.config input file used with LDT for this testcase


To run this case: 

(a) Modify the ldt.config file provided here for your local file 
directory setup.

(b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to local working directory. 

(c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file to
generate the LIS_RST_RAPID_router_202312010000_EN18.d01.nc 
output. 

./LDT ldt.config


Caveats: 
(a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purposes
of learning major LDT features.
