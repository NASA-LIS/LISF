Focus:  Imposing or Filling Native MODIS-IGBP (NCEP) Landcover
         with the MODIS 44w Landmask

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of 'Native' MODIS-IGBP landcover parameter obtained from 
      the original NCEP institution source website and imposing the
      LIS-produced MODIS 44w Landmask.

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided with this case to point to your
       local data directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your local working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       which include the MODIS 44w landmask and MODIS landcover input parameters.  
      To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf, 
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
