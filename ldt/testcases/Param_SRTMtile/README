Focus:  Native SRTM-30 Elevation Parameter

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of 'Native' SRTM30 elevation parameters obtained from the 
      original USGS institution source website

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config provided and point to your local
       input data directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the Noah 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have 
       it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
