Focus:  LISHydro preprocessing for WRFHydro

Description:  This case involves the processing LIS-WRF-Hydro parameters
      writing WRF-compatible output.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file used with LDT for this testcase
  (c) input.ctl GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided here for your local file 
       directory setup.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to local working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file, 
       and generate the NLDAS-2 forcing output for a selected domain.

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
