Focus:  Noah LSM Native Parameters with 'Filling' 
      Options Turned On

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of 'Native' 2-D Noah LSM parameters obtained from the 
      original NCEP and NCAR institution source websites
      and ensures mask-parameter consistency by turning on
      fill options for each parameter so the output could
      be used in an actual LIS run. 

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the LDT config file to point to your local data directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the Noah 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have 
       it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
