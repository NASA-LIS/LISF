TSMM Observation Simulator Test Case

This LDT test case generates synthetic observations of TSMM using LDT's 
"Observation Simulation" runmode. This feature is intended for OSSE experiments.

This simulator can handle the use of external orbital masks to be applied to 
the observations created for OSSEs. Currently, AMSR2, TSMM, Sentinel-1A, 
and MODIS are available instrumental options.

This directory contains:

* this README file.
* the ldt.config file used for this testcase.

To run this test case:

* Generate the LDT executable.
* Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file and sample input data.
* View the output using ncview.
