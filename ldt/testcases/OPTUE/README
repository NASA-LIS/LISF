OPT/UE Parameter Processing Run Mode Test Case

This case tests the processing of LIS-generated OPT/UE files using LDT.

This directory contains: 

* this README file
* the ldt.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the input data needed for this testcase (input/)

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LDT executable. 
* Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file and the sample 
  input data.

  See the official LDT documentation for more information.

Notes:

This feature was added in Pull Request #183
https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF/pull/183

Enables LDT to read the OPT/UE outputs from LIS and extract the
calibrated parameters. A new runmode to support this feature has been
added ('OPTUE parameter processing'). In this runmode, the LDT will
extract the parameters from the OPT/UE output file and then add them
to the LIS domain/parameter file generated by LDT.
