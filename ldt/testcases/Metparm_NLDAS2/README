Focus:  NLDAS-2 Forcing Elevation Parameter Processing

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of NLDAS-2 elevation parameters obtained from the 
      original USGS institution source website.

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (c) the ldt.config input file used with LDT 
  (b) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config provided with this case to match your 
       file directory setup.

  (b) Generate and copy your LDT executable to your working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file, 
       and the NLDAS-2 forcing elevation parameters.  
       To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
