Focus:  CLSM F2.5 LSM  Parameters 

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of  2-D CLSMF2.5 LSM parameters to be used
      with the CLSM "Fortuna-2.5" model version in 
      LIS.

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;

 To run this case: 

  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided with this case pointing 
       to your file directory setup.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       to process the final CLSMF2.5 2-D input parameters.  
      To run, enter:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
