  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output.

To run this case: 

  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided with this case to point
       to your input directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf,
      or with the ncview executable (if you have it installed).
