Focus:  Constant Value Parameters

Description:  This test case involves the processing of 
   user-specified "Constant" parameter value entries.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the wget script to download the MOD44w mask file:
       wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output.

To run this test case: 

  (a) Run the wget script to obtain the MOD44W mask file:

     sh wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf,
      or with the ncview executable (if you have it installed).
  
  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data with the script:

       sh wget_constant_outputfiles.sh
       tar -xzvf Public-LDT_Constant_output_v71.tar.gz

      to compare with the output generated with this testcase.

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
