Focus:  Native PRISM Precipitation Climatology Parameters

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of PRISM precipitation climatology parameters.

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file 
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided to point to your input
       data directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the PRISM 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf,  
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
