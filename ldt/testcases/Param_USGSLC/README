Focus:  Imposing or Filling Native USGS Landcover

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of 'Native' USGS landcover parameter obtained from USGS

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify your ldt.config file that is provided and point to your
       local input directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file 
       and the USGS landcover input parameter.  To run type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
