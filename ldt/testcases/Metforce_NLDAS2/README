Focus:  NLDAS-2 Forcing Dataset Processing

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of NLDAS-2 forcing data obtained from the 
      NASA GES-DISC and generated onto domain over
      Mid-Atlantic U.S.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file used with LDT for this testcase
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this case: 
 
  (a) Modify the ldt.config file provided here for your local file 
       directory setup.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to local working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file, 
       and generate the NLDAS-2 forcing output for a selected domain.

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
