Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) Retrievals Test Case

REPLACE REMAINDER OF README WITH DESCRIPTION OF THIS TEST CASE

This test-case performs a 1/8 degree simulation over CONUS with the
TEMPLATE lsm option from 2002-01-01 to 2019-01-01 to test the processing
of vegetation optical depth retrievals from the Land Parameter Retreival
Model (LPRM).

This directory contains: 

* this README file.
* the ldt.config file used for this test case. (This file should be 
  edited to make sure that the locations of the parameter and 
  forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* the input data needed for this testcase (input/)

To run this test case: 

* Generate the LDT executable. 
* Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file and the sample 
  input data. 

Notes:

This feature was added in Pull Request #174 (https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF/pull/174).

The LPRM data was obtained from Dr. Richard de Jeu and vandersat.com
