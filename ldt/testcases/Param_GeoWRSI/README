Focus:  GeoWRSI LSM Native Parameters

Description:  This case involves the processing
      of 'Native' 2-D GeoWRSI LSM parameters to
      be used in an actual LIS run. 

This case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the ldt.config input file to LDT
  (c) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Modify this ldt.config file to point to your input
       file directories.

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the GeoWRSI 2-D input parameters.  To run type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf, 
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
