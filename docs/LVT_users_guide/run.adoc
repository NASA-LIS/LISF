== Running the Executable

This section describes how to run the LVT executable.

The single-process version of `LVT` is executed by the following command issued in the _$WORKING/run/_ directory.

....
% ./LVT <configfile>
....

where `<configfile>` represents the file containing the run time configuration options for LVT. Currently LVT only supports a serial mode.

To customize your run, you must specify a LVT runtime configuration file. See SectionÂ <<sec-lvtconfigfile>> for more information.
