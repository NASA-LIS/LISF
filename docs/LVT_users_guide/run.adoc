== Running the Executable

This section describes how to run the LVT executable.

First you should create a directory to run LVT in. It is suggested that you run LVT in a directory that is separate from your source code. This running directory shall be referred to as _$RUNNING_. Next, copy the LVT executable into your running directory

....
% cp $WORKING/LVT $RUNNING
....

The single-process version of `LVT` is executed by the following command issued in the _$RUNNING_ directory.

....
% ./LVT <configfile>
....

where `<configfile>` represents the file containing the run time configuration options for LVT. Currently LVT only supports a serial mode.

Some systems require that you submit your job into a batch queue. Please consult with your system adminstrator for instructions on how to do this.

Note that before running LVT, you must set your environment to have an unlimited stack size. For the Bash shell, run

....
% ulimit -s unlimited
....

To customize your run, you must specify a LVT runtime configuration file. See SectionÂ <<sec-lvtconfigfile>> for more information.
