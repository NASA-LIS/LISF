== Introduction

This is the User's Guide for Land surface Verification Toolkit (LVT;<<kumar_etal_gmd_2012>>).
This document describes how to download and install LVT codes and
instructions on building an executable.

This document consists of 9 sections, described as follows:

. *<<sec-intro>>*:
   the section you are currently reading.

. *<<sec-backgrd>>*:
   general information about the LVT.

. *<<sec-prelim>>*:
   general information, steps, instructions, and definitions used throughout the rest of this document.

. *<<sec-obtain-src>>*:
   the steps needed to download the source code.

. *<<sec-build>>*:
   the steps needed to build the LVT executable.

. *<<sec-run>>*:
   the steps needed to run the LVT executable.

. *<<sec-lvtconfigfile>>*:
   describes the user-configurable options.

. *<<sec-metricslisttable>>*:
   describes the specification of various metrics in LVT.

. *<<sec-modeloutputlisttable>>*:
   describes the specification of the model output from LIS.

==== Version 7.1

. Supports Global Change Observation Mission - Water (GCOMW)
observations
. Supports Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data
. Supports Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinit (SMOS) observations
. Supports Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinit (SMOS) L1 Tb observations
. Supports MODIS LST data
. Supports Great Lakes Hydro data
. Supports time lagged computations

==== Version 7.0

Note that LVT has been renumbered to version 7.0.

. Supports NLDAS-2 SAC datasets, including the post-processed SAC soil
moisture on Noah levels
. Supports the capability to compute metrics on a basin/region scale
rather than on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
. Supports the capability to process USGS ground water well data
. Supports the capability to process Plate Boundary Observatory data
(snow depth and soil moisture)
. Supports the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) data
. Supports the ALEXI data
. Supports the metric to compute percentiles for each ensemble member
separately
. Supports GRACE observations (these are the "`processed`" GRACE
observations generated by LDT)
. Supports the UW ET data
. Supports the options for restart for SRI, SPI, SSWI and percentile
calculations
. Supports metric called SGWI - standardized ground water index — which
is similar to SSWI, but for TWS variable
. Support for a number of ratio variables are added:
* SWE/P (snow water equivalent over precip)
* ET/P (evapotranspiration over precip)
* Qs/P (surface runoff over precip)
* Qsb/P (subsurface runoff over precip)
. Supports the river flow variate metric
. Supports metrics for computing min, max and sum
. Support to read LIS DA processed observations

==== Version 1.2

. Updates related to OptUE processing

==== Version 1.1

. Added the plugin for processing processed LIS DA observations
. Removed the FEWSNET SOS processing metric
. Added plugins for NLDAS2, Natural streamflow
. Updated to provide backwards support for LIS 6.1.

==== Version 1.0

. This is the initial version developed for evaluating output from LIS
version 6.0 or higher.
