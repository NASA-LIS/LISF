== Introduction

This is the Users Guide for Land surface Verification Toolkit (LVT; <<kumar_etal_gmd_2012>>).
This document describes how to download and install the LVT software.  It also describes LVT`'s run-time configuration options (the _lvt.config_ file).

This document consists of 9 sections, described as follows:

. *<<sec-intro>>*:
   the section you are currently reading.

. *<<sec-backgrd>>*:
   general information about the LVT.

. *<<sec-prelim>>*:
   general information, steps, instructions, and definitions used throughout the rest of this document.

. *<<sec-obtain-src>>*:
   the steps needed to download the source code.

. *<<sec-build>>*:
   the steps needed to build the LVT executable.

. *<<sec-run>>*:
   the steps needed to run the LVT executable.

. *<<sec-lvtconfigfile>>*:
   describes the user-configurable options.

. *<<sec-metricslisttable>>*:
   describes the specification of various metrics in LVT.

. *<<sec-modeloutputlisttable>>*:
   describes the specification of the model output from LIS.

==== Version 7.0

Note that LVT has been renumbered to version 7.0.

. Supports NLDAS-2 SAC datasets, including the post-processed SAC soil
moisture on Noah levels
. Supports the capability to compute metrics on a basin/region scale
rather than on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

observations generated by LDT)
. Supports the UW ET data
. Supports the options for restart for SRI, SPI, SSWI and percentile
calculations
. Supports metric called SGWI - standardized ground water index — which
is similar to SSWI, but for TWS variable
. Support for a number of ratio variables are added:
* SWE/P (snow water equivalent over precip)
