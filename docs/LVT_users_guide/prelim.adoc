== Preliminary Information

This section provides some preliminary information to make reading this guide easier.

Commands are written with a fixed-width font. E.g.:

....
% cd /path/to/LVT
....

....
% ls
....

"`... compiler flags, then run `gmake`.`"

NOTE: The `%` symbol represents the command-line prompt. You do *not* type that when entering any of the commands.

File names are written in italics. E.g.:

_/path/to/LVT/src_

//You need to create a working directory on your system to install LVT.  Let's call this directory _/path/to/LVT/_. Throughout the rest of this document, this directory shall be referred to as _$WORKING_. You should create a directory to run LVT in. This directory can be created anywhere on your system, but, in this document, we shall refer to this running directory as _$WORKING/run_.
