== Running the Executable

This section describes how to run the LDT executable.

First you should create a directory to run LDT in. It is suggested that you run LDT in a directory that is separate from your source code. This running directory shall be referred to as _$RUNNING_. Next, copy the LDT executable into your running directory.

....
% cp $WORKING/LDT $RUNNING
....

The single-process version of `LDT` is executed by the following command issued in the _$RUNNING_ directory.

....
% ./LDT <configfile>
....

where `<configfile>` represents the file containing the run time configuration options for LDT. Currently LDT only supports a serial mode.

//Note that when using the Lahey Fortran compiler, you must issue this command to run the single-process version of LDT:
//
//....
//% ./LDT -Wl,T
//....

Some systems require that you submit your job into a batch queue. Please consult with your system adminstrator for instructions on how to do this.

Note that before running LDT, you must set your environment to have an unlimited stack size. For the Bash shell, run

....
% ulimit -s unlimited
....

To customize your run, you must modify the _ldt.config_ configuration file. See SectionÂ <<sec-ldtconfigfile>> for more information.
