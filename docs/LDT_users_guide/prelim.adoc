== Preliminary Information

This section provides some preliminary information to make reading this guide easier.

Commands are written with a fixed-width font. E.g.:

....
% cd /path/to/LDT
....

....
% ls
....

"`... compiler flags, then run `gmake`.`"

NOTE: The `%` symbol represents the command-line prompt. You do *not* type that when entering any of the commands.

File names are written in italics. E.g.:

_/path/to/LDT/src_


//You need to create a working directory on your system to install LDT. 
//
//Let's call this directory \file{/path/to/LDT/}.
//Throughout the rest of this document, this directory shall be referred to as
//\file{\$WORKING}.  You should create a directory to run LDT in.
//This directory can be created anywhere on your system, but, in this document,
//we shall refer to this running directory as \file{\$WORKING/run}.
