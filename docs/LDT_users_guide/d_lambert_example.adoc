== Lambert Conformal Domain Example

This section describes how to compute the values for the run domain and param domain sections on a Lambert conformal projection.

Note that this projection is often used for a coupled run with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. As such, Lambert domains are first generated when configuring WRF via WRF's preprocessing system (WPS). The domain information is then copied into LIS`' _lis.config_ file.

Please see WRF's User's Guide found at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/ for more information.
