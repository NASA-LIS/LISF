== Overview

The *Data Assimilation (DA) subsystem* in LIS is primarily used for state estimation (i.e., correction of model states based on observations) and supports the interoperable use of multiple land surface models, algorithms, and observational data sources. The DA subsystem also provides support for concurrent data assimilation, forward models, radiance assimilation, and observation operators employing advanced data fusion methods (i.e., deep learning). Advanced data assimilation algorithms such as _Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)_ and _Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EnKS)_ are available.

The DA subsystem outputs a number of diagnostics including:

* DA innovations, normalized innovations, and ensemble spread
* Processed/bias-corrected/quality-controlled (QC'd) observational data

The Land Verification Toolkit (LVT) handles automated processing of these outputs.

== The Perturbation Configuration Files

=== Forcing Perturbations

Forcing variables and perturbation settings are defined in the files named `forcing_attribs.txt` and `forcing_pert_attribs.txt`, respectively. The paths to these files are set in the LIS configuration file (see _Forcing perturbation options_ annotation above).

.`forcing_attribs.txt` specifies the variables and their ranges:

== Run LIS - SMAP DA Experiment

You're now ready to run LIS to perform the SMAP DA experiment. From `$WORKING_DIR`, run the LIS executable with the config file for this step:

[source,shell]
----
./LIS -f lis.config_noah36_smapda
----

Using one processor, as we are here, the run will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. If the run fails, troubleshoot the issue by reviewing any errors printed to the terminal and by viewing the contents of `lislog_smapda.0000`. If no errors print to the terminal, verify that the run completed successfully by checking for the following confirmation at the end of the `lislog_smapda.0000`:

[source,shell]
----
% tail lislog_smapda.0000
...
LIS Run completed.
----

View the output of the run using `GrADS`, `ncview`, Matlab, or other software. Compare the output generated by this run with the output of the Open-Loop case from Step 2.

== Wrap Up

You have completed the SMAP Data Assimilation Experiment. In Step 7, you will use the Land Verification Toolkit (LVT) to process the output of the OL and DA runs.
