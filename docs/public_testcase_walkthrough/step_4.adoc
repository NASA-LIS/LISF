== Overview

In the previous step you used LDT used to expand a single-member ensemble restart file into a multi-member restart file containing 12 ensemble members. In this step you will use LDT again to generate files that support scaling and bias-correction between the model open-loop states and satellite observations that will be assimilated in Step 6. LDT supports the generation of domain and statistical moment inputs for estimated cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), which can be used when performing the scaling necessary to assimilate certain observations in LIS. The model-based CDF files generated in this step, and those generated in Step 5 for the satellite observations, will be incorporated in the data assimilation run demonstrated in Step 6.

[NOTE]
====

*CDF-based scaling* is used to match the CDF of a given observation to that of the model.

CDF generation and CDF-based scaling are performed separately for each grid point. CDF-based scaling corrects all moments of the distribution regardless of its shape and requires enough sampling density to derive these scaling parameters. By comparison, normal deviate-based scaling corrects the first and second moments (e.g., the mean and variance).

<1> The "DA preprocessing" mode is used to generate the observation domain and scaling parameters.
<2> A successful run will generate a domain file (i.e., `cdf_noah36_domain.nc`) and a LSM CDF file (e.g., `cdf_noah36.nc`).
<3> The LDT run domain should reflect the intended observation grid (projection and resolution). _Note that this can differ from the model resolution and projection._

== LDT Output Files

During this run LDT produced a domain file, `cdf_noah36_domain.nc`, and a LSM CDF file,  `cdf_noah36.nc` in the `DA_proc_LSM` directory. If GrADS is installed, use the provided GrADS descriptor files to plot the output shown below.
