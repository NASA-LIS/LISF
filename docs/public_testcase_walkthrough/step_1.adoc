== Overview

In this step you will learn how to run LDT to perform parameter processing for the Noah-3.6 land surface model (LSM) and generate a Noah-3.6 parameter input file which will be used by LIS and LVT in later steps.

=== Steps to Running LDT

. Gather input data needed by LDT
. Modify `ldt.config` file to define runtime configuration settings
. Run the LDT executable
. Examine output

NOTE: These testcases were designed to be run in sequential order and later steps require the output generated by earlier steps.

include::download_input_files.adoc[]

In addition to the `LISF/` directory and the three executables, your `$WORKING_DIR` should now contain the following directory and files:

[cols="2*",frame=topbot,stripes=odd]
[%autowidth]
|===
|`INPUT/`                   |A directory that will hold parameter and input files needed throughout the testcases
|`ldt.config.noah36_params`    |The runtime configuration file read by LDT in this step
|`target_lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc` |The "target" NetCDF file generated by LDT in this step
|`target_log/` |A directory containing the "target" mask-parameter log and the "target" ldt diagnostic file generated by LDT in this step
|===

Files and directories beginning with `target` are provided to compare with the output of your run.

== The LDT Configuration File

The LDT configuration file contains input settings used by LDT at run-time to generate input files for LIS. The configuration options are described in depth in the {url-lisf-docs}[LDT Users' Guide,window=_blank].

Before continuing, review the contents of the LDT configuration file for our LDT-based Noah.3.6 parameter testcase by printing the file contents to the terminal with `cat` or opening the file with a text editor such as `vim` or `emacs`. Key elements of the file are highlighted below:

[#cat-ldt-config]

=== Noah Land Surface Model Parameters

As you may have noticed, these testcases utilize NOAA/NCAR's Noah LSM, v3.6. The input parameters selected in `ldt.config.noah36_params` include:

[cols="2*",options=header,frame=topbot,stripes=odd]
[%autowidth]
|===
|Parameter |Dataset
|Landcover |MODIS-based IGBP landcover map (~ 1 km, NOAA)
|Soil texture |FAO+STATSGOv1 combined soil texture map (~ 1 km, NOAA)
|Greenness fraction |AVHRR-based monthly climatology (1.0 deg, NOAA)
|Snow-free albedo |Monthly climatology dataset (1.0 deg, NOAA)
|Maximum snow albedo |MODIS-based maximum snow albedo (0.05 deg; Mike Barlage, NCAR)
|Bottom of soil column temperature |ISLSCP-1 climatology dataset (1.0 deg)
|===

=== Testcase Domain

The spatial domain defined in the LDT configuration file will be placed in `lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc`, the NetCDF-formatted parameter file generated by LDT which LIS will read in automatically at run-time. For these testcases we will be using the domain depicted by the black box on this map:

== Run LDT - The Parameter Processing Step

include::running_ldt.adoc[]

[NOTE]
--
ldt, lis, and lvt can also be run by submitting batch jobs using SLURM (**S**imple **L**inux **U**tility for **R**esource **M**anagement).  If you are running this tutorial on Discover, you can download example batch scripts for all steps from the {url-lis-testcases-page}[LIS Testcase website] using the following command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
% curl -O {url-lis-testcases-data}{download-batch-scripts-filename}
% tar -xzf {download-batch-scripts-filename} -C .
----

The batch scripts (`step*.job`) will unpack into the appropriate directories. To submit a job to discover using a batch script, use the command `sbatch [BATCH SCRIPT]` from the same directory as the job you wish to run.  The command `squeue -u [YOUR USER ID]` will provide updates on your job. If the job crashes, troubleshoot using any `slurm.out` files. 

See the {url-nccs-discover-jobs-page}[NCCS Discover Jobs Users' Guide] for more information.

== LDT Output Files

The following files are typically generated by an LDT parameter processing run:

[cols="2*",frame=topbot,stripes=odd]
[%autowidth]
|===
|`lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc` |The NetCDF-formatted model parameter file which LIS reads at runtime. `d01` refers to the indexed domain, typically used as "nests" for NASA-Unified WRF simulations.
|`ldtlog.0000` |The output diagnostic file that provides runtime messages, including warnings and error messages. This file is useful for verifying successful run completion and troubleshooting unsuccessful runs.
|`MaskParamFill.log` |This diagnostic file informs of any disagreements between an LSM-based parameter and the landmask, and whether any parameter gridcells were "filled" to agree with the landmask.
|===

NOTE: The output filenames for `lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc` and `ldtlog.0000` can be defined in the `ldt.config` file, but the filename of `MaskParamFill.log` cannot be modified.

=== The LIS Parameter File

The contents of the LIS parameter input file produced by LDT can be examined visually using a command-line program such as http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html[`ncview`,window=_blank] or a desktop application like NASA's https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/[Panoply,window=_blank]. For this walkthrough we will be using `ncview`. If needed, add `ncview` to your environment by running, `module load ncview`.

Open the LIS input file using `ncview`:

[source,shell]
----
% ncview lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc
----

In the `ncview` window that opens, click on the widget labeled *DOMAINMASK*. A second window will open containing a map of the mask. The domain we are using is a simple rectangle so, as expected, all values are equal to `1`.

Click on the widget labeled *LANDMASK*. Again, the values are all equal to `1`. This indicates that all grid cells within the domain are treated as land and, as a result, the input file should _not_ contain any undefined values (e.g., `-9999`).

.LANDMASK dataset
image::step_1_landmask.png[]

Click on the *LANDCOVER* widget to view the landcover variable. In the bottom third of the `ncview` window, click on the widget below the label _Current_ to cycle through the 20 different http://www.eomf.ou.edu/static/IGBP.pdf[IGBP landcover and land use classes]. In the screenshot below the _Crop_ class is selected (the classes are zero-indexed in `ncview`; add 1 to index to convert to IGBP class).

.The _Crop_ class of the *LANDCOVER* dataset
image::step_1_landcover.png[]

Click on the *TEXTURE* widget to view the soil texture dataset. Click on the widget below the label _Current_. This is the FAO+STATSGO soil texture map, aggregated using the `tile` option for the `Soil texture spatial transform:` setting in `ldt.config`. The map shows the fraction, or frequencies, of each soil type within each 0.25° degree grid cell of our domain.

.Soil texture, tile-based aggregation
image::step_1_soil_texture_tile.png[]

LDT provides several other options for grid cell aggregation including `none`, `mode`, and `neighbor`. What would the output look like if we were to rerun LDT after switching from `tile` to `mode`? Open `ldt.config.noah36_params` in a text editor and change the `Soil texture spatial transform` option from `tile` to `mode` as below:

[source,shell]
----
...
Soil texture spatial transform: mode
...
----

Rerun LDT:

[source,shell]
----
% ./LDT ldt.config.noah36_params
----

Check the end of `ldtlog.0000` to verify LDT ran successfully. Again, open the LIS input file using `ncview` and click on the *TEXTURE* widget.

image::step_1_soil_texture_mode.png[]

Each soil type now shows a total value of 1 within each 0.25 degree grid cell of our domain. Why? The `mode` option selects the _dominant_ soil type for each grid cell.

For comparison:

.Dominant vs. fractional soil type
image::step_1_soil_texture_comparison.png[]

Another program called `ncdump` can be used to directly view the datasets contained in NetCDF files. For example, the `-h` flag can be used to print the dimensions, variable names, and attributes of the file to the terminal:

[source,shell]
----
% ncdump -h lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc
netcdf lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01 {
dimensions:
    east_west = 28 ;
    north_south = 22 ;
    east_west_b = 32 ;
    north_south_b = 26 ;
    month = 12 ;
    time = 1 ;
    sfctypes = 21 ;          # Note: 21 includes “openwater” surface type
    soiltypes = 16 ;
    elevbins = 1 ;
    slopebins = 1 ;
    aspectbins = 1 ;
variables:
    float time(time) ;
    float DOMAINMASK(north_south, east_west) ;
          DOMAINMASK:standard_name = "DOMAINMASK" ;
          DOMAINMASK:units = "" ;
          DOMAINMASK:scale_factor = 1.f ;
          DOMAINMASK:add_offset = 0.f ;
          DOMAINMASK:missing_value = -9999.f;
          DOMAINMASK:vmin = 0.f ;
          DOMAINMASK:vmax = 0.f ;
          DOMAINMASK:num_bins = 1 ;
global attributes:
    :MAP_PROJECTION = "EQUIDISTANT CYLINDRICAL" ;
    :SOUTH_WEST_CORNER_LAT = 34.375f ;
    :SOUTH_WEST_CORNER_LON = -102.875f ;
    :DX = 0.25f ;
    :DY = 0.25f ;
    :INC_WATER_PTS = "true" ;
    :LANDCOVER_SCHEME = "IGBPNCEP" ;
    :BARESOILCLASS = 16 ;
    :URBANCLASS = 13 ;
    :SNOWCLASS = 15 ;
    :WATERCLASS = 17 ;
    :WETLANDCLASS = 11 ;
    :GLACIERCLASS = 15 ;
    :NUMVEGTYPES = 17 ;
    :LANDMASK_SOURCE = "MODIS_Native" ;
    :SFCMODELS = "Noah.3.6+Openwater" ;
    :SOILTEXT_SCHEME = "STATSGO" ;
    :GREENNESS_DATA_INTERVAL = "monthly" ;
    :ALBEDO_DATA_INTERVAL = "monthly" ;
----

=== Compare the Output

To further confirm that LDT ran successfully, you can compare your output with the "target" output included with the input files you downloaded earlier (files or directories beginning with `target_`). For example, use https://gitlab.com/remikz/nccmp[`nccmp`] to compare your `lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc` with `target_lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc`:

[source,shell]
----
% nccmp -dfs lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc target_lis_input.nldas.noah36.d01.nc
----

Where the flags `d`, `f`, and `s` enable the following options:

* `d`: compare data
* `f`: force comparison to continue after differences found
* `s`: report identical files to terminal (by default `nccmp` runs silently if files are identical)

NOTE: The `nccmp` command will be used in future steps. Going forward, some files may not be identical, but any differences reported _should_ be small. Also note: in this step, the target lis input file was generated using `Soil texture spatial transform: mode`

== Wrap-up

The LDT parameter processing run generates input parameters and files that LIS requires. Your `$WORKING_DIR` should now contain all the files needed to continue on to the next step.
