== Introduction

The {url-lis-website}[Land Information System framework (LISF)] public testcases described in this document provide users a suite of step-by-step experiments to learn how to run and test the LISF code. These experiments include a full end-to-end walkthrough of all three (3) components of the LISF; (1) the Land Data Toolkit (LDT), (2) the Land Information System (LIS), and (3) the Land Verification Toolkit (LVT). These testcases demonstrate how to use LDT to generate model parameter and assimilation-based input files, how to use LIS to run the Noah land surface model (LSM) for a sample "open-loop" (or baseline) experiment and a data assimilation (DA) experiment, and how to use LVT to compare output from the sample experiments. The testcases were created to demonstrate the use of LISF, however, the files provided could be expanded to support research-related model runs.

=== The Testcase Event: Snow Blankets the Southern Great Plains

In late April of 2017, link:https://www.weather.gov/gid/apr302017snow[a major snow storm event] occurred across the Southern Great Plains (SGP) and Rocky Mountains, an area spanning Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and southern Kansas. This storm event will be the focus of these testcases.
