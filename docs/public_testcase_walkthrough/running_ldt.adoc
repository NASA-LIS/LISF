You're now ready to run LDT:

. Copy your compiled *_LDT_* executable into `$WORKING_DIR/{ldt-run-dir}`
. Run the *_LDT_* executable using the provided `{ldt-config-filename}` file:

[source,shell,subs=attributes]
----
% ./LDT {ldt-config-filename}
----

The run should take a few minutes to complete. If the run aborts, troubleshoot the issue by reviewing any errors printed to the terminal and by viewing the contents of `ldtlog.0000`. If no errors print to the terminal, verify that the run completed successfully by checking for the following confirmation at the end of the `ldtlog.0000`:

[source,shell]
----
% tail ldtlog.0000
...
 --------------------------------
  Finished LDT run
