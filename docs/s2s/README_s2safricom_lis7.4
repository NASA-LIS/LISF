557WW LIS 7.4 -- S2S AFRICOM Forecast End-to-End System (E2ES) Master Doc
Kristi R. Arsenault (SAIC)
Last Modified 1 November 2021

This document describes the software and steps used to run the S2S-AFRICOM
forcing and model initial conditions, forecasts with LIS, generate netCDF4
formatted output files, and produce key metrics of the forecast output.

Postprocessing of LIS-NoahMP4.0.1 and HYMAP2 is now supported in terms
of combining the output files and providing in CF-compliant netCDF output
that is compliant with USAF naming conventions.

NOTE: Several shell scripts have been converted to Python 3 and checked
      with pylint.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE

* Stand-alone binaries:
  - NCO 5.0.1
  - CDO 1.9.10

LIST OF STEPS AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS:
-- Given in the order of which they should be run:

1. ldt_parms:  LDT Model Parameter Processing

  - LDT parameter processing case, where you set up and run
    LDT and the given ldt.config file and input parameters to
    generate the required LIS input parameter file that supports
    both Noah-MP v4.0.1 ("NoahMP401") and HyMAP v2 ("HyMAP2")
    models.

  - Note: This step only needs to be performed once as an input
    for the subsequent LIS and pre- and post-processing steps
    of the End-to-End system.


2. global_usaf_forc:  Generate AGRMET Ops atmospheric forcing for S2S

  - This forcing step configures and runs LIS in AGRMET Ops mode to generate
    atmospheric forcing for subsequent S2S data assimilation runs. No land DA
    is performed, and the ensemble size is set to 1. Gridded output is
    restricted to atmospheric forcing variables in GRIB1 format, which are
    saved (along with the final restart file) for subsequent use by S2S.

  - 3 scripts to configure and run LIS to generate USAF global atmospheric
    forcing data via "AGRMET Ops" mode. Scripts located in:

    LISF/lis/configs/557WW-7.4-FOC/S2S_GLOBAL
    - run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh:   <== Batch job script
      Calls:
      - customize_lis_config.py
      - store_lis_output.py

    - Set entries in run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh for output directory and
      scripts path; instructions can be found in the README file there.

    - Submit shell script via SLURM (sbatch), e.g.,:
    sbatch /absolute/path/to/run_lis_global_usaf_forcing.sh 20210801


3. lis_darun:  Run the LIS Data Assimilation (DA) Step to Generate
               the Initial Conditions (ICs) for the Forecast Runs

  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM and the HYMAP2 routing model
    in LIS for a 1-month simulation, with daily outputs, using
    12-member ensemble soil moisture and snow data assimilation for
    the 557WW ~25-km S2S AFRICOM domain.

  - Two scripts located in:  LISF/lis/utils/usaf/lis_darun
    - run_lis_darun_nrt_slurm.sh:   <== batch job shell script
      Calls:
      - generate_lisda_config_nrt.py

  - The python script, generate_lisda_config_nrt.py, creates the lis.config
    file to be run within the above SLURM batch shell script.

  - Submit shell script via SLURM (sbatch):
    sbatch /absolute/path/to/run_lis_darun_nrt_slurm.sh START_YYYYMMDD \
      END_YYYYMMDD

  - The batch script runs the LIS executable with the lis.config generated
    by the Python script â€“ designed to run for 1-month, up to the first of the
    initialized forecast month. For more details, please see README file
    at the above scripts directory.


4. ldt_ics:  Run LDT to Generate the IC Ensemble Restart Files from
             the LIS DA Run in Step #3.

  - This step generates the six NMME model-based ensemble restart files
    required to initialize the six NMME model-based forecasts using the LDT
    software for the 557WW S2S AFRICOM ~25KM domain for the Noah-MP-4.0.1 LSM.

  - HyMAP2 routing model restart files are single-member at this time, so
    they will be copied from the LIS DA run directories during operations.

  - 1 python script, located in:  LISF/ldt/utils/usaf/s2s_ensrst

    - generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py <== Python script

  - Set entries in script for input directory paths; instructions can be found
    in the provided README file.

  - Run python script from command line or called from a master E2ES script:

     ./generate_ldtconfig_files_ensrst_nrt.py

  - Output generated includes varying NMME model ensemble members for NoahMP401
    restart file and single member of HyMAP2 restart copied over for the
    forecast initial conditions.


5. bcsd_fcst:  Run the Bias-Correction Spatial-Downscaling (BCSD) Method
               and Scripts on the NMME and CFSv2 Forecast Datasets

  - This step preprocesses CFSv2 (non-precip) and 6 separate NMME
    precipitation forecast model data for driving the models offline in LIS.
    The forecasts are for the 557WW ~25 KM AFRICOM domain, bias-corrected
    using the USAF-LIS7.3rc8 (NAFPA precipitation-based) dataset, and covers
    up to 9 months of forecast input data to LIS.

  - 13 high-level scripts (1 main and 12 individual task scripts) to create
    bias-corrected and downscaled forecast forcings.

  - Scripts located in:  LISF/ldt/utils/usaf/bcsd_preproc

    - main_forecast.py  <== Main script

      Calls:
      - forecast_task_[01-12].py
      - check_preprocess_forecast_files.py

  - Set directories in the bcsd_preproc.config file. Instructions can be found
    in the README file for hi-level scripts and the README file in the
    lib_bcsd_metrics/ subdirectory for low-level python scripts.

  - Submit sequence of each task individually via:

     python main_forecast.py

  - Note: "forecast_task_02.py" script is for downloading the forcing
     datasets, like NMME forecast data. If data subscriptions are in
     place outside of this step, then this script can be commented out
     in the "main_forecast.py" script.


6. lis_fcst:  Running the LIS Forecast Step
  - This step runs the Noah-MP-4.0.1 land surface model and the
    HyMAP2 routing model in LIS using 24-member bias-corrected CFSv2 forcing
    (one of the six NMME models) for the ~25KM S2S AFRICOM domain in
    "forecast" run-mode.

  - 1 script to produce LIS forecast configs/sbatch script files and submits
    LIS runs for all six NMME models' precipitation forecast inputs.

  - Script located in:  LISF/lis/configs/557WW-7.4-FOC/S2S_AFRICOM

    - generate_s2safricom_fcst_config_scriptfiles.py <== Main script

  - Set working directory in the lisda.cfg file. Each model needs to be
    submitted individually and must be included from this list:

     CCM4, CCSM4, CFSv2, GEOSv2, GFDL, GNEMO

  - Generate and submit each LIS forecast model individually via:

   python generate_s2safricom_fcst_config_scriptfiles.py MODEL_NAME


7. lvt_s2spost:  S2S Forecast Output Post-Process Step

  - This step automates the conversion of LIS S2S-AFRICOM forecast output
    into daily and monthly netCDF4 files and ensures they are in CF-1.8
    convention.

  - 5 scripts to combine SURFACEMODEL and RUNOFF LIS netCDF files into
    daily and monthly netCDF files in CF-1.8 convention; runtime option for
    consolidating CF files into single output directory (for downstream users).

  - Requires NetCDF Operators (NCO) utilities. Configured for Discover.

  - Scripts located in:  LISF/lvt/utils/usaf/s2spost

     run_s2spost_9months.py:   <== Top-level python script
       run_s2spost_1month.sh:   <== Batch job script
         run_s2spost_1month.py:
           daily_s2spost_nc.py
             monthly_s2spost_nc.py

  - README file provided in the above directory that further describes the
    set of and sequence of scripts above.

  - To run the suite of scripts above, they can be initiated with:

  /absolute/path/to/run_s2spost_9months.py ldt_file topdatadir 202110 \
     nmme_forcing [--collect_output]


8. lvt_s2smetric:  S2S Forecast Metric Post-Process Step

  - The following set of scripts processes metrics for individual
    NMME model's LIS-based hydrologic monthly forecasts out to 9 months for
    a given month and year's initial condition.

  - The scripts read in the monthly post-processed files from Step #7
    above.

  - Final set of scripts convert the intermediate-based metric (netcdf) files
    to CF-1.8 convention, and merges the output into a single file.

  - 8 scripts to calculate metrics (anomalies, std anomalies), convert into
    CF-1.8 netCDF4 files, and create GeoTIFFs of medians.

  - Requires NetCDF Operators (NCO) utilities. Configured for Discover.

  - Scripts located in:  LISF/lvt/utils/usaf/s2smetric

   - postprocess_nmme_job.py:  <== Main script
     calls:
     - run_generate_metrics.sh:   <== Batch job script
