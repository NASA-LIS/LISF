== Preliminary Information

This section provides some preliminary information to make reading this guide easier.


=== Commands

Commands are written with a fixed-width font.  E.g.:

....
% cd /path/to/LISv7.0
....

....
% ls
....

"`... compiler flags, then run `gmake`.`"

NOTE: The `%` symbol represents the command-line prompt.  You do *not* type that when entering any of the commands.

=== File names

File names are written in italics.  E.g.:

_/path/to/LISv7.0/src_

//You must create a directory on your system to install LIS into.  Let's
//call this directory, _/path/to/LISv6.0/src_.  Throughout the rest of
//this document, this directory shall be referred to as _$WORKING_.  You
//must also create directory to run LIS in.  This directory can be
//created anywhere on your system, but it is suggested that you keep it
//separated from your source code.  Let's call the directory to run LIS
//in, _/path/to/LISv6.0/run_.  We shall refer to this running directory
//as _$RUNNING_.
