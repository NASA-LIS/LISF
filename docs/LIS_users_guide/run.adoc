== Running the Executable

This section describes how to run the LIS executable.

First you should create a directory to run LIS in.  It is suggested that you run LIS in a directory that is separate from your source code.  This running directory shall be referred to as _$RUNNING_.  Next, copy the LIS executable into your running directory.

....
% cp $WORKING/LIS $RUNNING
....

The single-process version of `LIS` is executed by the following command issued in the _$RUNNING_ directory.

....
% ./LIS
....

//Note that when using the Lahey Fortran compiler, you must issue this command to run the single-process version of LIS:
//
//....
//% ./LIS -Wl,T
//....

The parallel version of `LIS` must be run through an `mpirun` script or similar mechanism.  Assuming that MPI is installed correctly, the LIS simulation is carried out by the following command issued from in the _$RUNNING_ directory.

....
% mpirun -np N ./LIS
....

The `-np N` flag indicates the number of processes to use in the run, where you replace `N` with the number of processes to use.  On a multiprocessor machine, the parallel processing capbabilities of LIS can be exploited using this flag.

Some systems require that you submit your job into a batch queue.  Please consult with your system adminstrator for instructions on how to do this.

Note that before running LIS, you must set your environment to have an unlimited stack size.  For the Bash shell, run

....
% ulimit -s unlimited
....

To customize your run, you must modify the _lis.config_ configuration file.  See Section <<sec_lisconfigfile>> for more information.


=== Command line arguments

`LIS [-f <file> | --file <file>]`

`-f <file>`, `--file <file>`:: specifies the name of the lis run-time configuration file.
+
By default, LIS expects the run-time configuration options to be defined in a file named _lis.config_.  Use this command line argument to specify an alternate run-time configuration file.
