Note that the notion of a base forcing and a supplemental forcing have been replaced with the notion of a meteorological forcing.  Thus the support in _baseforcing_ and in _suppforcing_ have been combined into _metforcing_.

Note that LIS is developing support for surface types other than land.  Thus all the land surface models contained in _lsms_ have been moved into _surfacemodels/land_.

Note that the companion program LDT is now required to process input parameters.  Thus the support for static and climatological parameters have been removed from _params_ and placed into LDT.
