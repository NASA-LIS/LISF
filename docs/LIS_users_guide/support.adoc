=== Modeling Guru

The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) hosts a system called Modeling Guru, https://modelingguru.nasa.gov.  This system is a collection of forums discussing many of NASA's modelling efforts and related topics.  LIS has a "`community`" within Modeling Guru.

This is system is open for reading, but registration is required to post questions.  The front page of Modeling Guru provides information regarding requesting an account.


=== Requesting help

To request help from the LIS development team, please visit our community within Modeling Guru at https://modelingguru.nasa.gov/community/atmospheric/lis.  Select the "`Discussions`" tab.  Please review the existing posts; your question may already be answered.  If it is not, then please "`Start a discussion`" to post your question there.  Note that posting a question requires a registered account (see Section <<ssec_modelingguru>>).

When reporting a bug or an error running LIS, please provide a description of the problem, including any error messages printed to the screen.  Attach a copy of the _lislog.0000_ file.  Also attach a copy of any relevant supporting files such as: +

For LIS:

* _lis.config_
* _lislog.0000_

* _configure.lis_ (in your make directory)

For LDT:

* _ldt.config_
* _ldtlog.0000_
* _configure.ldt_ (in your make directory)

For LVT:

Please note that the LIS development team does not receive funding to provide community support.  Your questions and issues are important to us, but we can address them only when time permits.

Please note that, due to U.S. federal law, we are not allowed to respond to anyone from a designated country.  (See http://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/nasaecp/.) By policy, we will not respond to messages from either non-institutional or non-organizational email addresses; e.g., we will not respond to email messages from gmail.
