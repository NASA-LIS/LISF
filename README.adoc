== Overview

The link:{url-lis-website}[Land Information System (LIS)] is a software framework for high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation developed with the goal of integrating satellite and ground-based observational data products and advanced modeling techniques to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes.

Development of LIS is led by the link:{url-hsl-website}[Hydrological Sciences Laboratory] at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

The software suite consists of three modeling components:

. *Land surface Data Toolkit (LDT)*, a formal environment that handles the data-related requirements of LIS including land surface parameter processing, geospatial transformations, consistency checks, data assimilation preprocessing, and forcing bias correction,
. *Land Information System (LIS)*, the modeling system that encapsulates physical models, data assimilation algorithms, optimization and uncertainty estimation algorithms, and high performance computing support, and
. *Land surface Verification Toolkit (LVT)*, a formal model verification and benchmarking environment that can be used for enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation of model simulations by comparing against a comprehensive suite of in-situ, remote sensing, and model and reanalysis data products.
